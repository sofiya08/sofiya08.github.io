								<p>When two Aries come together in a love affair, there’s bound to be fireworks. These two are always competing, which can make for quite a challenging love match. An Aries-Aries relationship is like looking into a mirror: Aries understands their partner’s need for independence because they’re the same way. At times, however, they can be possessive and turn into two Rams butting heads. They have to learn not to compete with one another so much. If they can do so, their partnership can be extremely powerful.</p><p>An Aries-Aries love match is a meeting of two strong spirits; generally, the relationship is positive and enthusiastic. They love to try new things — often extreme sports or some other intense activity. Solving the inevitable problems of a close relationship can be tough due to the two egos constantly clashing. They must learn to work together. Since both partners like things to go their way, they must make a conscious effort not to be selfish. Aries also has a natural generosity, however, so two Aries together can certainly learn to take turns indulging each other. Aries is very open with their feelings; totally straightforward, two Aries will never have problems with deceit or hypocrisy. Both partners will have trouble with temper outbursts that result from hasty judgments. Aries just wants to get on with it, already!</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars. Mars was the God of War, and, like two soldiers in a battle, two Aries can either fight together or against each other — but they will fight. Mars also represents passion, and Aries tends to have an active and exciting time with any lover. This energy is only heightened with another Aries. And, though arguments are inevitable for this pair, the best is yet to come — first of all, Aries is too busy to hold a grudge for long, and besides, making up is so much fun!</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign. It’s rare for one partner to get tired while the other still wants to continue; two Aries will play hard together and tire at the same time. Again, two Aries maintain a constant battle over who will be the leader. Neither partner likes to submit, so compromise is essential. If these two can keep their egos in check, the relationship will be smooth.</p><p>Aries is a Cardinal Sign. In an Aries-Aries combination, both partners are skilled at initiation. When they see what they want, they pursue it without a moment’s thought. They never waste time feeling each other out before they jump into a relationship.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Aries relationship? That exciting spontaneity that always keeps things new and that’s so hard to find with other Signs. Two Aries will never be bored! Their mutual energy and ability to make up after disagreements makes theirs a passionate and compatible relationship.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="aries_taurus" class="hidden">
								<p>When Aries and Taurus come together in a love affair, the partnership is a natural union of Love, represented by Taurus, and Passion, represented by Aries. This relationship is all about balance. Aries wants to jump right in and get into it, while Taurus prefers to go much more slowly. This can create a problem; Taurus loves to be wooed and romanced — two concepts that are basically foreign to straightforward, brash, totally unsubtle Aries. An Aries-Taurus partnership can be a great learning experience for both Signs. Taurus can help Aries rein in some of the more foolish, impractical impulses, and Aries can help Taurus be more spontaneous and adventurous.</p><p>Taurus is sensual, patient and gentle. Aries is attracted to these qualities; Aries sees Taurus as their rock, totally stable and loyal forever. Taurus sees Aries as possessing that quality they want more of — knowing when and how to grab on to life’s opportunities. These Signs are a good balance for each other. Aries might sometimes play games with Taurus, playing off that Bullish laziness, or try to push Taurus into making hasty decisions, but the Bull can usually convince the Ram to slow down a bit. Aries brings excitement to the relationship, while Taurus brings security and romance. When Aries wants instant gratification, Taurus can show just how sexy and sensual slow, deliberate movement can be.</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars (passion), and Taurus is ruled by the Planet Venus (love). Venus and Mars go well together; they represent the two necessary halves of the same relationship coin. The symbols are universally recognized as masculine and feminine, so this relationship is a good balance of these energies.</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign and Taurus is an Earth Sign. Aries wants to take charge of their own destiny, while Taurus needs to be assured of security and stability. Sometimes Taurus can be possessive, which independent Aries won’t tolerate. If Aries can assure Taurus that the relationship is strong and that Aries isn’t going anywhere, Taurus can be as flexible and tolerant of independence as Aries needs them to be.</p><p>Aries is a Cardinal Sign, and Taurus is a Fixed Sign. In this relationship, Aries is not going to get their own way no matter how hard they try — so it’s a much better idea not to try at all. Taurus is a Fixed Sign that won’t budge; Aries will get much further with finesse and charm (Taurus is a real sucker for both) than with argument, since Taurus never loses a debate. Both Signs want to be the leader in the relationship, so compromise is essential.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Taurus relationship? The passionate nature of the partnership. This is an excellent balance of energy between masculine and feminine, impulsive and deliberate. Their contrasting personalities and ability to learn from one another make theirs a mutually giving and satisfying relationship.</p>

							<div id="aries_gemini" class="hidden">
								<p>When Aries and Gemini come together in a love affair, they connect on a physical as well as an intellectual level. These two Signs love activity and stay optimistic even in the most trying of times. Signs that are two apart in the Zodiac usually enjoy excellent communication and a deep understanding of one another. Aries’s independent, pioneering spirit is attractive to Gemini, who also values independence. If Gemini feels that Aries is being too controlling or if Aries takes Gemini’s flirtatious nature too seriously, arguments may set the tone of the relationship. They create a good balance together: Aries wants to experience things and Gemini wants to discuss them. Together they can make all kinds of new discoveries that they might have missed alone.</p><p>Both Aries and Gemini have tons of energy as well as common goals. Gemini is a thinker and a talker, prizes intellectual stimulation and freedom and loves to look at all sides of an argument. Aries loves to jump into new projects and get their hands dirty, and Gemini will definitely take the time to find out Aries’s reasons for choosing the projects they support. While Gemini can be wishy-washy, Aries is straightforward and decisive; this is a great combination, but it is essential that Aries allows Gemini intellectual space.</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury. These Planets represent Passion and Communication, respectively. Because of their different approaches, Aries and Gemini work great in tandem — they get their points across in different ways, but they definitely get those points across. Fevered debates will either spice up this union — or ruin it. Aries needs to understand that Gemini loves a good, fiery argument, not to insult or dominate their challenger but as a great brain workout.</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign and Gemini is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and makes it spread, making this a great combination. Gemini also helps Aries realize their full potential — Gemini definitely has the energy to keep up with Aries’s fast pace and wild ideas! The combination of true, driving passion and intellectual prowess makes just about anything possible for these two. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and the best part is, at the end of a long and active day, Aries can come home and tell chat-hungry Gemini all about it!</p><p>Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Aries naturally initiates new plans — travel, sports or just a really exciting date idea — and Gemini is always up for anything, as long as they aren’t forced into it. Another great dynamic between these two Signs is their low level of competition. Aries loves the glory and Gemini is perfectly happy to be in the background, pulling the strings. Both Signs are better at starting things than ending them, so if one partner gets bored with the direction the relationship is taking, the other won’t resent moving on toward something new.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Gemini relationship? Their ability to work together as a single unit. Together they can learn much more than either Sign would alone.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="aries_cancer" class="hidden">
								<p>When Aries and Cancer come together in a love affair, it’s a case of opposites attracting. Aries is rash and brash while Cancer is sensitive and emotional. Aries can certainly be emotional — in a fiery, impetuous way that can completely overwhelm Cancer. Even though Cancer usually likes to take time with relationships, Aries’s whirlwind approach can be extremely stimulating. Aries, on the other hand, may find the Cancerian sensitivity appealing; it’s a good balance for the typical Aries bluntness. Troubles may arise if Cancer’s mood swings or Aries’s aggression becomes hurtful. Both Signs must take time to listen to their partner’s needs and understand that they’re coming from different directions to meet a common goal.</p><p>Cancer is the Sign of Home while Aries is the Sign of Self. One great dynamic between these two is that both Signs are extremely protective of those they love. Cancer uses that Crab shell to draw around themselves and their family and mate when trouble is near, while the Ram uses their strength and bravery, like a knight in shining armor. Cancer also provides Aries with a happy domestic life and emotional security. Sometimes they might build an idealized image of their Aries partner or be overly possessive, which can really grate on independent Aries. However, Aries can help by reassuring their Cancer partner that they are loved and cherished. Aries really needs to learn to listen to Cancer: the Crab operates on an instinctive level and their advice can help Aries avoid making silly mistakes caused by that typical Aries lack of planning.</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Cancer is ruled by the emotional Moon. Mars was the God of War, and Aries is a soldier meeting every challenge head-on. Aries’s open, passionate nature appeals to Cancer, who often internalizes emotions and feelings. Cancer can have intense, feminine energy and Aries can help them learn to release it. The Moon controls tides of the Earth, quietly affecting all life; similarly, Cancer works behind the scenes (while Aries rushes into battle). Cancer tends to be sentimental and can teach Aries to slow down and appreciate life instead of always rushing on to the next thing.</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign and Cancer is a Water Sign. These two elements can be a great combination if they work together, using both emotion and action to get things done. Cancer can help Aries slow down and learn to be gentle, while Aries teaches Cancer to come out of their shells. But Cancer can be emotionally manipulative — sometimes there’s just too much Water dampening Aries’s enthusiasm. Conversely, too much Fire can cause Water to evaporate, leaving Cancer emotionally raw. Aries and Cancer must talk openly and freely to ensure their balance is maintained.</p><p>Aries and Cancer are both Cardinal Signs. Both Signs are initiators, but they have to learn to cooperate. On the surface, Aries is the leader, always rushing out to meet a challenge, but Cancer is also indirectly in charge through emotional control and the ability to weigh the situation. Cancer tends to compromise more easily while Aries can be unwilling to yield, so the Crab may have to accept giving in.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Cancer relationship? Once they realize they’re on the same team, the combination of Fire and Water works well together. Aries is out there getting attention and Cancer is quietly supporting the back end. Each partner’s ability to provide what the other is lacking makes theirs an equal relationship.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="aries_leo" class="hidden">
								<p>When Aries and Leo come together in a love affair, the sparks will fly! Both are Fire Signs, passionate and dynamic, with a healthy love of sportsmanship and competition. There is a lot of action in this relationship. Both Signs want to be the boss and problems can arise when their equally-large egos get in the way. These partners have genuine admiration and respect for each other, but they need to learn to take turns commanding and giving orders — even when they’re only choosing a movie at the video store!</p><p>This partnership is all about fiery passion, domination and who’s on top — and when! Both Signs can be impatient and proud. Leo likes to be adored and their egos to be stroked, services which easily-bored Aries may not want to provide. Aries may also be bothered by Leo’s flirtatious nature — but this relationship is always exciting. Despite their sometimes noisy differences, Aries often looks to Leo as a guide or counselor. Leo is the Lion and, with Leo, Aries can be the lamb. As in the myth (The Lion and the Lamb), any differences between these two can be overcome. Both Signs are usually respected by others and it’s important that this respect exists within the relationship as well.</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Leo is ruled by the Sun. Both are masculine energy archetypes, and together they make a good combination — they understand each other because they’re coming from the same place. The Sun is about the self and Mars is about aggressive energy, so they’re highly compatible and can make a powerful team.</p><p>Both Aries and Leo are Fire Signs. This tends to be a very heated and passionate relationship. When it’s good it’s very, very good, but when it’s bad it’s all about loud arguments and damaged egos. In this partnership there’s always competition as to who’s in charge. Since a love relationship shouldn’t be about power, this can become a problem. Both of these Signs have boundless energy, so both will always be on the go. Although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don’t last long — Aries is too busy moving on to the next challenge to hold a grudge. Leo needs to remember not to be resentful if their Aries lover doesn’t show them enough respect.</p><p>Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Leo is a Fixed Sign. Aries gives Leo the assertiveness to charge ahead and take chances, while Leo can help teach Aries to stabilize and follow things through. Aries may sometimes hurt Leo’s feelings by saying something hurtful without thinking. Conversely, Aries may be irritated by Leo’s bossy nature and tendency to sulk. But they’re both loyal and care about each other deeply, and when they can understand there doesn’t have to be a boss, their relationship can be exciting bliss.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Leo relationship? The mutual admiration both Signs share for one another. With Aries as the initiator and Leo as the one who follows through, they both have their integral niche within the partnership. Their mutual energy and passion makes theirs a dynamic relationship.</p>

							<div id="aries_virgo" class="hidden">
								<p>When Aries and Virgo come together in a love match, they may think at first that they have nothing in common and nothing to learn from one another. This relationship takes time to develop as each partner must learn to understand where the other is coming from. Aries and Virgo can seem like total opposites: While Aries is brash, dominant and aggressive, always jumping into new things and almost always impatient, Virgo is detail-oriented and quiet, even shy, and works patiently toward long-term goals. Aries’s energy is fiery and impetuous while Virgo’s is much slower and more grounded. It’s these very differences, however, that can teach Aries and Virgo so much, once they just look beneath one another’s surfaces to see what lies beneath.</p><p>Early in the relationship, Aries and Virgo may see nothing but one another’s faults. Virgo thinks Aries is way too brash, and Aries thinks Virgo is extremely fussy. But if they focus on one another’s strengths instead, they’ll discover a great deal. Aries teaches Virgo about fun and excitement, about the spontaneity that is often missing in Virgo’s life. Virgo teaches Aries patience and attention to detail, the knowledge that the little things — and moments — are important too. Aries can teach their Virgo lover to take things less seriously. Virgo can teach Aries to be polite and value hard work.</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Virgo is ruled by the Planet Mercury. Aries wants to rush out and fight without wasting time preplanning or strategizing. Conversely, Virgo wants to analyze everything and work out all the details before acting. These are such opposite approaches that strife can result. Both Signs must make a conscious effort to learn from one another’s method rather than letting their partner’s natural rhythm bother to the point of distraction.</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign and Virgo is an Earth Sign. Where Aries is all fiery impetuosity, Virgo is grounded practicality. Virgo weighs all the options before devoting any serious effort, while Aries simply sees what they want and dives in! This is true both in career and in personal relationships — which can be something of a stumbling block. If Aries has decided it’s Virgo they want, they might be frustrated for some time to come, waiting for Virgo to make up their mind about whether the relationship is a good idea.</p><p>Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Virgo is a Mutable Sign. Virgo doesn’t need to be the leader or the boss; they’re glad to follow another’s suggestion once they decide it’s a viable one. Aries, on the other hand, wants to make those suggestions — every time. This is a beneficial dynamic if these two Signs are working as a team toward a common goal.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Virgo relationship? Their great effectiveness as a team — business or personal. Their personalities, opposite in so many ways, make for a highly complementary relationship.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="aries_libra" class="hidden">
								<p>When Aries and Libra come together in a love affair, the inherent polarity of the Zodiac is invoked. Aries and Libra are directly opposite one another in the Zodiac — 180 degrees apart. Each Sign possesses qualities that the other lacks; combined with Libra’s natural yen for harmony, this can be a relationship that enjoys great balance. Aries is the Sign of Self while Libra is the Sign of Partnership, and the differences continue: Aries is impulsive, excitable and ready to jump right into something new and exciting, while Libra is indecisive, peace-loving and prefers a calm, smooth approach. Aries can learn from Libra that their own way isn’t necessarily the best way.</p><p>These two Signs share the great sexual attraction common to all Signs opposite in polarity. At the same time, though this pair’s connection is amazing when it’s good, it can be extremely challenging when it’s bad. All polarities have energies that tend to tangle or knot if understandings can’t be reached. As a combination, Aries and Libra are well-balanced. Charming, cultured Libra can teach brash Aries something about style. Libra prizes harmony in a relationship and will go to great lengths to maintain it. Aries is very decisive and can teach indecisive Libra about relying on intuition for answers.</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus. This is a great match, as these are the Planets of Passion and Love, respectively. Venus and Mars go well together as they’re the two sides of the love relationship coin. They’re universally recognized as male and female and this relationship is a good balance of masculine and feminine energy. Venus is about the beauty of romance while Mars is about the passion of romance. What a good combination!</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign and Libra is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and helps it grow and spread. Aries can have a very positive effect on Libra’s growth, ideas and progress; Aries can help Libra put their ideas into action. Working together can be challenging at times, however, due to their polarity. Aries’s fast-paced, impetuous approach to projects may conflict with Libra’s more balanced, intellectual approach. However, both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and at the end of a long, active day, Aries can come home full of interesting stories to tell the more cerebral Libra!</p><p>Aries and Libra are both Cardinal Signs. They both have a lot of initiative — but lack in follow-through. They both tend to start things they’re never going to finish, whether it’s a job, a project, a relationship … Aries will appear to be the leader because of their energy and forceful nature, but Libra leads from an intellectual standpoint. Both Signs want to be in charge, but Aries uses force and sometimes intimidation to get what they want while Libra uses charm and sometimes manipulation. Compromise is essential to this relationship’s health. Diplomatic Libra has a much easier time with compromise than does Aries, who strongly dislikes yielding to another person, viewing it as submission. Libra may have to give in more often to Aries’s wishes in order to keep the peace that they so cherish.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Libra relationship? The harmony resulting from the union of Venus and Mars. The balance between self and other represented by this polarity is a great learning experience for both Signs. Each brings to the relationship what the other is missing, making for a wonderful balance.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="aries_scorpio" class="hidden">
								<p>When Aries and Scorpio come together in a love match, it can be the kind of relationship where they both wonder how they ever managed apart. Both Signs love power and they can achieve just about anything — as long as they learn to share the spotlight. Scorpio is very focused; once they set their sights on Aries, Aries is most likely powerless to resist! Scorpio has a deeper and more complex devotion to this relationship than does Aries.</p><p>These two Signs tend to engage in heavy, heated arguments. Their connection is highly passionate and often argumentative, because both partners have jealous tendencies. Scorpio tends to be more patient, but is also more possessive than Aries — and can lash out (with that Scorpion sting!) when their feelings get hurt. Despite their differences in emotional involvement, both partners love risk and taking chances; this is not a boring relationship! Aries and Scorpio can have lots of adventures together. They may have trouble understanding one another — Aries is a true extrovert, totally up-front and open, while Scorpio is more inward, emotional and, at times, manipulative. Sometimes a truce is necessary to keep things running smoothly!</p><p>Aries and Scorpio are both ruled by the Planet Mars (Passion), and Scorpio is also ruled by Pluto (Power). When two people with Mars’s energy come together, it’s like two soldiers on a battlefield — they’re either allies or deadly enemies. Mars also represents passion, so Aries and Scorpio tend to have an exciting time together (both in the bedroom and out of it!). Arguments are normal in such a challenge-oriented couple — and making up is definitely something to look forward to! Pluto adds extra intensity to this dynamic.</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign and Scorpio is a Water Sign. These two elements can be a great combination if they work together, combining emotion and physical action to get things done. Scorpio is a strategist, and can help Aries slow down and learn how to plan battles before jumping into them. Aries teaches Scorpio to let go and move on when their efforts are thwarted. However, Water can also put out a Fire, and Scorpio’s tendency toward emotional manipulation has that effect on Aries — it’s too much Water dampening Aries’s enthusiasm. Conversely, too much Fire makes Water evaporate away; when under emotional stress, Scorpio can become vindictive. It’s essential for Aries and Scorpio to work together, not against one another.</p><p>Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Aries can teach Scorpio about spontaneity — doing things just for the experience, rather than always having an agenda in mind. Scorpio can help teach Aries to stabilize and finish things rather than always jumping into new projects without completing what’s already on the table. When they can understand that they’re both loyal and devoted to one another, they can both be the boss — Aries as the initiator and Scorpio as the emotional leader.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Scorpio relationship? The power of their combined forces. They’re both winners and they won’t give up, making theirs a relationship that never settles for second best.</p>

							<div id="aries_sagittarius" class="hidden">
								<p>When Aries and Sagittarius come together in a love affair, it can be a match made in heaven! These partners have much in common — similar energies and interests — and are highly compatible. Both are explorers and pioneers. This relationship is torrid and exciting and both partners are always ready for a new adventure. They both crave life experience of their own and don’t like to waste time just reading about it or listening to others tell about theirs. They do need to be careful, however: This could be an accident-prone relationship as Aries is always in a rush and Sagittarius tends to look at everything but the obvious. Also, as much as these two have in common, it may be difficult to maintain a long-term relationship when both parties have so much energy to start new things — but not much interest in following through.</p><p>Aries and Sagittarius make great friends as well as lovers. They truly understand one another’s optimistic view of life. Problems are rare, but Sagittarius has an even greater need for independence than does Aries, who can sometimes be overly possessive. Aries is also a bit more sensitive than the fun and flirty Archer; Sagittarius can tend to put their foot in their mouth, so to speak, by speaking without thinking. The good thing is, both Signs are able to forgive and forget fast. They don’t have time to spend holding a grudge!</p><p>Aries is ruled by Mars (Passion) and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (Philosophy and Luck). Both of these Planets are masculine, so these Signs tend to look at the world in the same way. Sagittarius likes to take a risk under Jupiter’s indulgent influence. Mars is all about initiative, taking (sometimes aggressive) action. When Aries comes up with a new, exciting idea for a date, trip or other adventure, Sagittarius is always ready and willing to go along for the ride.</p><p>Both Aries and Sagittarius are Fire Signs. This combination can produce an eternal flame. Both Signs are always on the go. They have endless resources of energy; it’s rare for one partner to fizzle out on the other.</p><p>Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Aries initiates new ideas and Sagittarius will go right along with it — as long as they’re allowed to come along. There’s never any power struggle between these two related to ’who’s on top.’ Aries likes to have all the glory and Sagittarius is happy to control events from behind the scenes. Both Signs are better at starting things than ending them, which can be trouble if one or both Sign feels that the relationship is becoming stale; thank goodness that’s so unlikely! Aries does get bored easily, but Sagittarius always keeps life fast-paced and fun.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of an Aries-Sagittarius relationship? Their mutual tendency to be the pioneers and explorers of the Zodiac. They are well matched in their enthusiasm, energy and drive. Their common interests and similar personalities make them a very compatible couple.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="aries_capricorn" class="hidden">
								<p>When Aries and Capricorn come together in a love match, they must work hard to maintain their mutual energy. Their approaches can seem almost opposite to one another — Aries is all about acting without bothering to consider where the action is directed or what it will attain, while Capricorn is all about judging whether (or how much) it will benefit them before they take action. Aries moves fast and, to Capricorn, at least, seems to risk it all. Capricorn abhors unnecessary risk. They move at a slower pace, working inexhaustibly toward well-defined goals (usually related to career or other forms of public advancement). Both partners always get where they’re going, only in different ways — and usually where they’re going is totally different, too!</p><p>Capricorn is generally rather quiet and unassuming while Aries is much louder and more flashy. They’re both very stubborn and think their way is best, so in order to work together, they have to agree to disagree. Their philosophies are very different: Aries looks for the shortcut while Capricorn wants to follow the rules, assuming they’re a tried-and-true path to success. How does this manifest itself in a romantic relationship? Aries is all about impetuous, passionate pursuit of the one they want, without stopping to think whether the one they’ve chosen is really the right one for them. Capricorn, on the other hand, likes to analyze how much a potential love partner will be able to help them advance in life, and will use that as the basis of their decision of whether or not to pursue the relationship. If these two can meet and get together, however, they can teach one another things they wouldn’t learn on their own.</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars (Passion) and Capricorn is ruled by the Planet Saturn (Karma). These Planets often work against one another, just as Aries and Capricorn have to struggle to find common ground. These two can definitely help one another, however, especially on a project: Saturn has strong powers of perseverance, but Mars has the energy and drive it takes to get things done. These two Signs might make a better duo in the workplace than in the bedroom! Both partners tend to be resolute and neither gives up easily; if their energies are not channeled in positive ways, together these Planets may inflict cruelty, even violence on one another, or cause one another to repress their emotions. Aries must take care not to work against Capricorn, who, in turn, must try not to dampen Aries’s fiery spirit.</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. While Aries is dynamic, Capricorn is more grounded and practical. Capricorn’s approach is to ask themselves, ‘What good will this do as I work toward my main plan in life?’ while Aries simply sees what is desirable at the moment and goes after it with no set plan in mind.</p><p>Aries and Capricorn are both Cardinal Signs. Both partners are initiators, but they have such widely varying goals and interests that they work better when they each have a particular, well-defined role. Aries is the leader on the surface — they rush out to get things going and knock down any barriers in the way. But Capricorn is indirectly in charge: They’re always working steadily toward their goals. It’s important for both partners to understand that compromise is their key to success.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Capricorn relationship? They each bring unique qualities to their union. Once they can learn to allow each other to be themselves they can blend well to make a whole. Theirs is a challenging relationship, but if they can learn from each other it’s worth it! As with any relationship based in mutual love and respect, most obstacles can be overcome with sound communication and goodwill.</p>

								<p>When Aries and Aquarius come together in a love match, the combination of Aquarius vision and Aries action makes them a highly creative pair. Their relationship is anything but static; they can be competitive, but life with these two is never dull! Zodiac Signs that are two apart tend to have a special connection, and these are no exception. They are great friends as they communicate really well. They have a special understanding of one another’s idealistic, enthusiastic outlook on life. They both crave excitement and new experiences — the wilder and stranger, the better. They’re both into thrills and showing off.</p><p>Many Aries-Aquarius relationships are based on mutual admiration. Aries loves how unique Aquarius is, their inventive vision of the world; Aquarius loves Aries for their energy and initiative — Aquarius gets new ideas all the time but sometimes finds it hard to carry them out. Since both Signs prize independence, Aries’s tendency toward possessiveness can push Aquarius to become aloof or detached as a self-preservation tactic. Though they have that special connection, they do see the world in very different lights, which they both need to understand. Aries can be too involved for Aquarius’s taste, and Aquarius in turn may be too unpredictable for Aries. As it turns out, Aquarius is the one Sign that has Aries beat when it comes to spontaneity! As long as both partners reassure each other that the relationship is important and secure, things will be just fine.</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars (Passion) and Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn (Karma) and Uranus (Rebellion). Aquarius gets its great, progressive vision from Uranus, and its social conscience and philanthropy from Saturn. Mars, then, can make a great addition to the mix — it brings passionate, direct action to all these lofty thoughts and ideals.</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and helps it spread; similarly, Aquarius can help Aries think up new schemes and then realize them. Aquarius stimulates Aries intellectually, something that most of the other Signs fail to do. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, so mentally active Aquarius is sure to provide physically active Aries with plenty of fodder for new adventures and crusades.</p><p>Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Aries gives Aquarius the confidence to charge ahead rather than just sitting in the laboratory concocting new ideas. Aquarius can help Aries stabilize and complete projects rather than jumping into new plans without completing the old ones. They have a lot of respect and admiration for one another, which helps smooth any obstacles in their relationship.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Aquarius relationship? Their ability to achieve so much when they work together. Cardinal Fire and Fixed Air cover all the bases. Theirs is a relationship of vision as well as practice.</p>

								<p>When Aries and Pisces come together in a love match, they can be very good for one another. Aries is a strong Sign; they are almost completely prey to their impulses, which they follow without a second thought to the outcome or possible consequences. Dreamy Pisces is much quieter and more internally-focused; they’re the Poets of the Zodiac. On the surface an Aries and a Pisces may seem an unlikely pair, but when there’s love involved, they can truly fulfill one another’s needs. Pisces is very intuitive, both as a person and as a lover; Aries must take care to return this favor so Pisces won’t begin to see their Aries partner as stingy and selfish.</p><p>Aries is a leader with tons of initiative. When Aries finds someone attractive they’ll launch the pursuit without a second thought. When the ‘prey’ is gentle Pisces, Aries tends to take on the role of protector. The funny thing is, Pisces is the real protector, as the intuitive, deeply understanding partner who provides a relaxing sort of refuge for hectic Aries. Pisces is a Water Sign; they can fill any container, so to speak. They are so giving and empathetic that sometimes they can become something of a doormat — they give themselves completely to their partners, and if their partner can’t do the same, trouble may result. Pisces understands Aries in a deeper way than most other Signs do, so this can help alleviate this type of problem: Pisces knows how to keep Aries from becoming overly brash or rash. Together they form a dynamic team when they combine Aries’s directness with Pisces’s intuitive understanding of other people.</p><p>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars (Passion) and Pisces is ruled by the Planets Jupiter (Luck) and Neptune (Illusions). Mars brings passionate action to Neptune’s dreamlife. Aries helps Pisces bring their fantasies into reality. Jupiter lets Pisces help Aries tone down their overt style of operation.</p><p>Aries is a Fire Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. Though these opposite elements can sometimes create trouble for one another (Fire makes Water evaporate, Water douses Fire). However, they can combine to make a great team: Pisces can help Aries relax a little and learn listen to others’ feelings, while Aries teaches Pisces to get out into the world and take the kinds of risks that lead to real payoff. This is an effective lesson for Pisces, who definitely has the brain power to figure out which risks are good ones to take and which are best left alone. Aries and Pisces must simply negotiate to ensure their balance is maintained.</p><p>Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Unlike Aries, Pisces doesn’t need to be the leader or ‘on top.’ They enjoy lending a hand when they’re needed, but certainly don’t need to direct a project — a good thing, since Aries needs that position for themselves. Together these two Signs can achieve a positive end to any project they decide to undertake.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aries-Pisces relationship? They really have a lot to learn from each other. Pisces shows Aries how to empathize and care; Aries teaches Pisces how to make dreams happen rather than just thinking about it! Theirs is a truly reciprocal relationship.</p>

								<p>When two Taureans come together in a love affair, it’s a very sensuous and stable relationship — which pleases both of them to no end. Those are two of the things a Taurus prizes most in a relationship (along with fidelity, sharing good food and other creature comforts …) When two people both of this Sign get together, it can be the love connection of a lifetime. They will spoil one another to both their hearts’ content: Taurus can respect their sweetheart’s desire for life’s little luxuries, because they have that need themselves. Both partners are charming, graceful and dignified. They can be quite stubborn and opinionated, not to mention jealous and possessive. All Tauruses have to learn to agree to disagree, and especially two Tauruses together; they need to recognize that their relationship is too good to jeopardize with minor arguments.</p><p>Taureans are blessed with strong willpower and commitment. They love the wooing process of courting, so the beginning, building stages of their relationship may stretch out deliciously. Taureans rarely rush into a relationship, but once they’re committed, it’s solid — maybe even for life. When two Taureans get together, both provide and expect total devotion. Because of this devotion, a Taurus-Taurus pair may be more possessive of each other than most. Nothing upsets these lovers more than infidelity, but — luckily — because both partners are so dedicated to each other and the relationship and because Taureans tend to be very reliable, cheating is rare.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by the Planet Venus. When two people with Venus energy come together, it can be love at first sight. Both partners are highly romantic and loving, and they never tire of physical contact and touching. They are the great stamina Signs of the Zodiac; they love to go all day and all night and all the next day … They are highly sensual and both enjoy pampering. Emotional security is very important to them, but when this is guaranteed these partners can be as decadent and indulgent as they please. They can tend to be lazy, becoming overly relaxed in the moment, but generally they work very hard to maintain the lifestyle of luxury that they prefer.</p><p>Taurus is an Earth Sign. These two most likely love to garden (they share a mutual love of beauty). Earth Signs are also about possessions, and two Taurus partners usually surround themselves with beautiful things — a lovely home, artwork, luxurious fabrics, expensive cars. They also share a love of rich, fine foods — a regular fitness routine might not be a bad idea for these two to help them keep off those extra pounds!</p><p>Taurus is a Fixed Sign. In a Taurus-Taurus combination, both partners persevere when working toward their goals — and both stand by their opinions as if it’s a matter of life or death. They generally shy away from change, preferring life to be stable, steady and predictable. Once these two make up their minds that the relationship is a good one, they will devote themselves to each other. But if they have differing ideas, they may find themselves in a never-ending battle of wills. If they understand they’re working together toward a common goal, then anything will be possible for this pair.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Taurus relationship? Their incredible loyalty to each other and their dedication to continuing the romance — no matter how long-term the relationship is. Their mutual love of romance and comfort makes theirs a highly devoted and long-lasting relationship.</p>

							<div id="taurus_gemini" class="hidden">
								<p>When Taurus and Gemini come together in a love affair, they must both take the time to learn what the dynamics of the relationship are and how they can best get along. They both have much to offer one another and much to learn in this relationship, but it will take a bit of adjustment and effort on both sides. Gemini&rsquo;s Symbol is the Twins; this Sign can often be of two minds about things. If possessive Taurus is able to let go and give one Twin the relationship security and intimacy it wants while allowing the other Twin its freedom, things will go well between these two. Taurus may want too much for Gemini&rsquo;s taste early in the relationship, but Gemini can become dependable and steady &mdash; Taurus must simply be patient.</p><p>Taurus&rsquo;s sedate, practical approach to life differs greatly from Gemini&rsquo;s more light, intellectual approach. This can be a difficult dynamic, since Gemini may see Taurus as a bit dull while Taurus may see Gemini as flighty and lacking in substance. They have much to teach one another, however: Taurus can help Gemini become more deeply involved in life; Gemini can help Taurus add variety, fun and excitement to their life.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Since both of these Planets are close to the Sun, they&rsquo;re always in the same neighborhood even though they&rsquo;re very different. Venus is all about physical pleasures, romance and sensuality. Mercury has both masculine and feminine energy, and Gemini takes on whichever energy best serves at any given moment. Taurus is just looking for a dependable, sensual partner, so Gemini&rsquo;s brilliance may be lost on the Bull. This may be trouble, since Geminis often feel like their quick wits are the most important thing about themselves. The good thing is, Gemini is smart enough to learn to be the romantic, sensual partner that Taurus craves.</p><p>Taurus is an Earth Sign and Gemini is an Air Sign. Gemini makes decisions based on intellect (and whim), while Taurus is more practical. Taurus asks, &lsquo;How will this help me achieve my goals in life?&rsquo; while Gemini goes with the moment, never feeling too pressured to stick to a set plan. If Taurus gives in to those Bullish possessive feelings, or if Gemini is aloof and detached (as they often are), this relationship may suffer. Both Signs must strive to stay open and flexible in order to make this union work. Though Gemini seems unpredictable, Taurus can learn to understand that although Gemini may flirt, the relationship is still important to them. And though Taurus seems overly stubborn, Gemini must use their flexibility to bend to their partner&rsquo;s will on occasion.</p><p>Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Taurus tends to focus on one thing, person, idea at a time, while Gemini moves from one thing (or person) to the next according to impulse. Taurus must provide Gemini with ample independence and breathing space &mdash; and try to learn Gemini&rsquo;s lesson, that versatility is sometimes better than a Fixed determination to do things one&rsquo;s own way.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the best aspect of the Taurus-Gemini relationship? The security the two can give each other once Taurus allows Gemini to offer that security freely. As long as both partners communicate with each other, theirs will be a stable and happy relationship.</p>

							<div id="taurus_cancer" class="hidden">
								<p>When Taurus and Cancer come together in a love affair, it’s usually a very good combination. They are two positions apart within the Zodiac, and such Signs tend to share karmic ties and a deep mutual understanding. These particular two Signs have much in common: Both prize security in a love relationship above almost all else; both tend to be nurturers (Cancer is emotionally nurturing while Taurus loves to spoil their lover with sensual delights, gifts and good, rich meals). They’re both quite domestic and love a quiet night spent at home with their sweetie.</p><p>The Taurus-Cancer partnership tends to be a happy one due to this mutual enjoyment of the security and comfort of home. They love a solid home base, a strong relationship, nice possessions, good food: all the comforts of domestic life. Theirs is often the ideal family that people of other Signs strive for, with strong ties between them and a relationship that is family-oriented rather than toward the outside world. Their only major problems arise when Taurus insists on having its own way and Cancer responds by sulking. Taurus must understand Cancer’s emotional sensitivity, and Cancer needs rely on open, honest communication than on emotional blackmail.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Cancer is ruled by the Moon (Emotions). Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Cancer often keeps emotions bottled up and simmering inside, which can lead to occasional boil-overs. Thus, Cancer is attracted to Taurus’s open, honest, unafraid nature. As the Moon controls the tides of the Earth, quietly affecting all life, so does Cancer, manipulating behind the scenes. Cancer tends to be sentimental, and both partners prefer to enjoy each other rather than socializing with large groups.</p><p>Taurus is an Earth Sign and Cancer is a Water Sign. Water and Earth are compatible as tangible, physical entities. As a Water Sign, Cancer is born to nurture an Earth Sign like Taurus the way rain nurtures Earth and helps crops grow. In turn, Taurus tends to have a more stable view of life than does Cancer and is less prone to emotional turmoil; therefore, Taurus can help Cancer stabilize their tumultuous feelings. Both Signs must be careful in this relationship, however: Taurus may tire of Cancer’s mood swings, and Cancer may in turn feel that Taurus is insensitive to their needs.</p><p>Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Cancer is a Cardinal Sign. Taurus has Fixed habits; they won’t change an opinion once it’s formed. This can provide Cancer with an emotional rock, as Taurus is entirely dedicated to the relationship. In turn, Cancer can bring new inspiration to the relationship and start new projects that Taurus will enjoy taking over later.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Cancer relationships? The steady, reliable team they make. Both Signs are dependable and nurturing, strongly oriented toward domestic life together. A mutual love of home and security makes theirs an ideal long-term, family relationship.</p>

							<div id="taurus_leo" class="hidden">
								<p>When Taurus and Leo come together in a love affair, they can be a great couple because they know how to stroke one another’s egos and love to have their own stroked! They have similar needs: Taurus needs plenty of affection, to be loved and cherished, while Leo likes compliments and wants to be adored and admired. They’re both extremely loyal and possessive lovers. Since they have such similar desires, they can generally provide for one another’s needs quite well.</p><p>These two Signs both love status and possessions. They prize physical comfort and luxury; Leo is often flamboyant about attentions and gift-giving, which will greatly please Taurus, who loves the most traditional forms of courtship. Though they can work together quite well, it’s not all roses between these two; both Signs are very stubborn and must work hard to understand and accept one another.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love and Money) and Leo is ruled by the Sun (Self). The Sun radiates warmth and light; Leo indeed radiates this kind of energy and enthusiasm. Venus is about love, beauty and luxury. This combination of masculine and feminine energy helps these two Signs admire and sustain one another. As a matter of fact, Venus is never more than 48 degrees from the Sun, so they belong close together! The Sun represents life and Venus represents love; as long as they are careful to understand each other, their combination is a positive one.</p><p>Taurus is an Earth Sign and Leo is a Fire Sign. They are both ambitious but in quite different ways. Leo longs for fame and fortune, while Taurus strives for security and stability in life and love. Since both these Signs expect to be the boss, they may tend to battle for domination. During arguments, Taurus abhors conceding a point, seeing it as acceptance of domination — unless they see that it’s the practical course. Their battles can be fierce and epic, but as long as both of them can be reassured that the relationship is important to their partner, things will go more smoothly.</p><p>Taurus and Leo are both Fixed Signs. This means they’re both stubborn; once they make up their minds about something, it takes a lot to get them to change it. That’s why their arguments can get so intense — both of them truly believe they’re right and that theirs is the only right way to look at an issue! They also both tend to shy away from change; they like to get things settled and then let them continue on as is indefinitely — even if something could be improved. If they decide that they want their love relationship to stay, almost nothing will convince them to leave their partner. This is good for the stability of the relationship but can be bad if the relationship is destructive or inhibitive.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Leo relationship? Their mutual admiration. Both Signs have very powerful personalities, so neither will dominate the other — no matter how hard they try! Others see them as an excellent match as they share the commitment to fulfilling their goals.</p>

							<div id="taurus_virgo" class="hidden">
								<p>When Taurus and Virgo come together in a love affair, it’s a union of innate practicality. Both of these Signs employ practicality in their daily lives as the most efficient means to most problems. They can be quite sincere and devoted to one another; as people, both have a great deal of integrity. Virgo likes Taurus’s strength and dedication while Taurus appreciates Virgo’s quick mind.</p><p>Due to Virgo’s naturally cautious nature, this relationship can take awhile to develop, but once it’s established that both partners are in it for the long haul, it’s like a runaway locomotive, running on its own power and difficult to stop. These two Signs have much in common: They highly value common sense and practicality; they’re both materialistic but work hard for the creature comforts they so enjoy. Taurus is more sensual and indulgent than Virgo is; Virgo tends to be the inhibitive force in the relationship, tending not to get involved in the chaos of life in favor of analyzing all available options. Virgo’s analysis leads to criticism, which Taurus can tend to take too seriously. Conversely, Taurus’s stubborn nature can get on Virgo’s nerves, causing Virgo to criticize even more! This pair must take care not to take one another too seriously. The good thing is, they’re similar enough that they can learn to be patient with one another, especially Virgo, who loves to indulge Taurus’s penchant for fine treatment and good food.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love and Money) and Virgo is ruled by Mercury (Communication). Both of these Planets are close to the Sun, so they’re closely related though they seem very different. Venus is physical; it’s about romance and sensuality, both of which are important to Taurus. Mercury is about communication and it’s androgynous — Virgo will take on the form that it chooses. Virgo is very good at understanding other people and can easily learn to be the romantic and sensual partner that Taurus loves. Both partners are so devoted and romantic, their arguments surely won’t focus on those issues.</p><p>Taurus and Virgo are both Earth Signs. Earth Signs are steady and practical, concerned with possessions. Taurus and Virgo together love to surround themselves with beautiful things — an opulent home, gorgeous artwork, classy cars. Their love of luxury and their desire to be financially secure ensure that this couple will work hard who never overspend.</p><p>Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Virgo is a Mutable Sign. Taurus is stubborn and tends to make up their mind for good; more flexible Virgo can help teach Taurus the value in bending the mind a bit — when it’s practical, of course.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Virgo relationship? Their dedication to working toward the same goals. Both partners enjoy luxury and nice things, and Virgo likes helping Taurus achieve their goals. Their common interests and desires make theirs a highly compatible relationship.</p>

							<div id="taurus_libra" class="hidden">
								<p>When Taurus and Libra come together in a love affair, it can be the unification of two halves of a whole. These two Signs are thought of as being karmically linked. They’re both looking for security in a relationship and they share a love of art, poetry and culture. This relationship may start slowly as, on the surface, they might have few common interests. However, once they understand one another they may learn they have much more in common than was first apparent.</p><p>Taurus and Libra both have a love for the arts. They appreciate fine dining and theater, collecting art and music. Pleasure — physical, aesthetic — is a premium for these two Signs. They both love to woo and be wooed; courtship is a necessary part of any romantic relationship for them, and since they both have this need, they fit well together. Taurus appreciates Libra’s charm; if stubborn Taurus doesn’t get their way, diplomatic Libra is able to smooth things over and keep the peace. Libra appreciates the luxuries that sensual Taurus provides them. They also have much to teach one another: Libra can help Taurus see the different sides of a situation, and Taurus can help Libra overcome their notorious indecision.</p><p>Both Taurus and Libra are ruled by the Planet Venus (Love and Money). These partners share a love of beauty, luxury, love and romance. Libra in particular is keen on balance; both partners have charming personalities and desire harmony in their personal relationships. Venus’s influence can create problems as well, however; these two Signs can both tend toward laziness and snobbery, Taurus based on possessions and Libra based on intellect.</p><p>Taurus is an Earth Sign and Libra is an Air Sign. Taurus gets through life relying on their innate practicality, while Libra relies on intellectual exploration. Taurus asks, ‘How will this help me achieve my goals in life?’ Libra, on the other hand, focuses on intellectual stimuli, whether it’s practical or not. Conflicts can arise in this relationship if Taurus seems too possessive or Libra seems too flirtatious and social. Sometimes they just don’t quite understand where the other is coming from. If they want theirs to be a long-lasting relationship, they must learn to accept that their views of the world are different in tone and focus.</p><p>Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Libra is a Cardinal Sign. In general in this relationship, Libra initiates it and Taurus keeps it going. A Fixed Sign won’t budge, and Libra needs to understand the Bull’s stubborn tendency. With some gentle persuasion, anything is possible — and there is no Sign more gifted at gentle, subtle persuasion and charm than Libra. On the other hand, Libra’s indecision may irritate direct, to-the-point Taurus. As long as Taurus tones down the tendency to declare that their way is the only acceptable way to do or see something, Libra can accept Taurus’s decisions.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Libra relationship? Their shared love of pleasure, beauty and culture. Aesthetics are integral to both partners, and their similar tastes and loves make theirs a relationship of great romance and harmony.</p>

							<div id="taurus_scorpio" class="hidden">
								<p>When Taurus and Scorpio come together in a love affair, their union is nothing if not intense, whether that’s in a positive or a negative way. They are opposite Signs in the Zodiac, giving them a special, complex connection. They can combine to make a whole, each partner’s strengths balancing the other’s weaknesses. Their sexual attraction is likely to be off the charts! Taurus and Scorpio have tons in common, but because their personalities are so powerful, they often swing between passionate love and passionate disagreement!</p><p>Taurus and Scorpio both have deep desires, Taurus for possessions and Scorpio for power. They’re both concerned with wealth and resources, and they’re both intensely passionate about all sorts of things. Taurus is a bit more self-focused than Scorpio, who is more concerned with their lover and immediate family. Both of these Signs have a great, deep-rooted need for security in a relationship, but with slightly different focuses. While Taurus prizes honesty and forthrightness and abhors infidelity, Scorpio loves to be mysterious. A Scorpio’s need for security is more about the need to be constantly reassured that their emotional connection with their loved one is strong. The good thing is, Taurus needs this reassurance too — and is also willing to provide it for their Scorpio lover.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love and Money) and Scorpio is ruled by Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power). This combination is very intense, thanks to Pluto’s influence, but it’s an excellent balance of masculine and feminine energy. Scorpio and Taurus together form the basis of all love relationships — love and passion. Venus and Mars go well together; Venus is about the beauty of romance, and Mars is about the passion of romance. Scorpio is smoldering and intense (and intensely sexual), and Taurus, a sensual and tireless lover, is attracted to this intensity. In turn, Scorpio enjoys the devotion inherent in Venus-ruled Taurus.</p><p>Taurus is an Earth Sign and Scorpio is a Water Sign. Scorpio tends to be very deep — like an ocean, too much upset will cause a tidal wave! When Scorpio feels crossed by a lover, watch out for that Scorpion’s tail, which can whip out and sting their lover without warning! It’s a good thing that these two Signs are so strongly loyal to each other. But while Taurus is open, with everything laid bare on the surface, Scorpio is more secretive and inscrutable. They can both teach one another about their opposite views of life (direct versus complex). Another factor adding a tantalizing dimension to this union is the two Signs’ mutual tendency toward jealousy. Taurus loves it when Scorpio displays their jealous — it means Taurus is adored and appreciated!</p><p>Taurus and Scorpio are both Fixed Signs. This means they’re both pretty stubborn and resolute once their minds are made up. Let’s hope their minds agree — if not, they’re prone to fights the likes of which neither experiences with any other Sign. Taurus seems to prevail as the dominant partner, but that’s not always the case. Scorpio can ‘win’ through more devious means, such as employing emotional manipulation to get what they want. These partners must learn to discuss their views and needs openly and to reach a compromise if they want their union to be lasting and happy. This largely depends on Scorpio’s ability to learn to trust Taurus. The relationship will only fail if the two partners truly cannot overcome their opinionated, fixed stances.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Scorpio relationship? Their powerful connection that can shine when obstacles to intimacy are cleared away. When Scorpio realizes that Taurus is there for the long term and won’t create the misery that some Scorpios attract to their lives, this relationship can blossom.</p>

							<div id="taurus_sagittarius" class="hidden">
								<p>When Taurus and Sagittarius come together in a love affair, their connection can be incredibly passionate and steamy, but they must give themselves time to learn about the particular energy this relationship generates. They both have much to gain from their union! While Sagittarius thrives when they’re constantly experiencing new people, places, foods and more, Taurus can be quite content with routine as it affords them the security they so prize. Early in the relationship, Taurus might tend to demand more commitment and stability than Sagittarius is ready to give, but if Taurus can learn to be patient, Sagittarius can definitely come to appreciate the comforts of hearth and home.</p><p>These two Signs approach life quite differently. Taurus tends to be sedate and practical, which offsets Sagittarius’s restless demeanor. Sagittarius may have trouble with Taurus’s seemingly dull complacency, and will try to rev Taurus up — which is about as smart and works about as well as trying to spark a slow, steady Bull to action! (In other words, watch out for those horns!) Taurus actually has much to offer Sagittarius, though Sagittarius may have trouble admitting their need for a secure base. Sagittarius can bring lots of fun and adventure into Taurus’s life.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (Luck). The Venus influence lends Taurus their love of beauty, luxury and sensual pleasures. The Jupiter influence is what marks Sagittarius as the Teacher of the Zodiac — Jupiter is concerned with philosophy, higher learning, expansion, optimism, luck and travel. Together this combination of beauty and expansion, masculine and feminine energy is why these two Signs admire and sustain one another.</p><p>Taurus is an Earth Sign and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. Sagittarius needs space to move around and flame brightly; Taurus, on the other hand, is down to earth and needs stability. Sagittarius relies on feeling and impulse to direct them through life, while Taurus is practical and concerned with efficiency. These approaches to life can either be complementary or sources of stress if the two Signs can’t learn to understand and accept one another. As long as they both take care to reassure the other that the relationship is special and important (Taurus, especially, needs this reassurance), things will run smoothly between them.</p><p>Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Taurus is stubborn; once their mind is made up, it takes a lot to convince them to change it. Sagittarius craves variety. If this urge to experience something new strays into the realm of experiencing new partners, Sagittarius had best beware. Taurus does not tolerate infidelity; if cheating occurs, Taurus will be deeply wounded and the relationship may not survive the strain. In turn, Taurus must give Sagittarius the freedom to enjoy other experiences and people (on a platonic level, of course!). Taurus can teach Sagittarius the benefits of a secure relationship; Sagittarius can show Taurus that flexibility is sometimes better than following a set, well-worn path.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Sagittarius relationship? The new perspectives they can give each other once each partner becomes familiar with the ways in which they differ. Theirs is a stable and happy relationship once they understand and accept these differences.</p>

							<div id="taurus_capricorn" class="hidden">
								<p>When Taurus and Capricorn come together in a love match, it’s a practical, sensible partnership. These two Signs share a certain down-to-earth logic and interest in efficiency. Taurus is not interested in risking more than is necessary in terms of emotional connection and involvement, and Capricorn is similarly disinterested in risk, but more in terms of money and career. Capricorn’s career is one of the great focuses of their lives; they’re interested in scaling the heights and tend to set very high standards for themselves to adhere to. Taurus has high standards as well, but regarding love, relationships and possessions.</p><p>These two Signs admire one another’s dedication and strength, but, while they have this in common as well as a dependable, realistic, somewhat conservative approach to life (Capricorn more than Taurus), a love relationship between them can go stale fast. The problem? They’re actually rather different at their cores. Taurus may begin to find Capricorn too conservative and restrictive; Capricorn may start to think Taurus is too lazy and doesn’t care enough about career and status. If Taurus can encourage Capricorn to relax a little and appreciate the fruits of labor, and if Capricorn can help motivate Taurus to achieve goals and make dreams a reality, their union can be smooth, happy and long-lasting.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Capricorn is ruled by Saturn (Karma). Venus is a warm, feminine energy while Saturn is a cold masculine energy. Venus is all about sensual pleasures, the aesthetics of love, the beauty of art. All of these stimulate Taurus and heighten their appreciation of life and love. Saturn, on the other hand, is about hard work and discipline to achieve goals. Taurus will show Capricorn how to enjoy a well-deserved break every so often and how to appreciate beauty and comfort. Capricorn can teach Taurus to be more disciplined and to keep reaching out for what one wants.</p><p>Taurus and Capricorn are both Earth Signs. This couple loves to indulge in material possessions. They want to possess and be surrounded by beautiful things — a lovely home, designer clothing, luxurious cars, works of art. Since they’re both such hard workers, they can usually attain all these things, and hardly ever need fight about impracticality or overindulgence.</p><p>Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign. Taureans won’t change their minds once they’re made up. They possess a quiet, steadfast determination. Instead of finding this dull or restrictive, Capricorn regards it as a good, comforting thing: Taurus is clearly dedicated to the relationship.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Capricorn relationship? The similarity of their values and their dedication to the same goals. Both partners enjoy luxury and nice things, and they share resources well. Their mutual interests make theirs a highly compatible relationship.</p>

								<p>When Taurus and Aquarius come together, they can move mountains — if they can figure out how to coordinate their efforts. Taurus’s practical, down-to-earth approach to life is about as opposite as can be to Aquarius’s unconventional, out-of-this-world approach to just about everything! Taurus resists change and Aquarius is the most progressive of all 12 Signs of the Zodiac. How do these two get along, then? They may appear to have few common interests, but they share a very strong desire to succeed — which means they may make better business partners than lovers.</p><p>Since these two can both be extremely opinionated, they must take care not to get into arguments, especially because of their dissimilar reactions to tension: When Taurus gets angry they tend to charge like the Bulls that they are; when Aquarius feels pressure, they tend to pull away, using an aloof demeanor to put space between themselves and their ‘tormentor.’ This can make Taurus push even harder, causing Aquarius to pull further away … and so on. They like to do things their way with as little fuss as possible. Modern, progressive Aquarius may find Taurus’s dedication to routine a bit boring. Taurus will find Aquarius exciting yet may feel frustrated trying to keep up with this inventor’s quick mind. Despite their differences, however, they do have something to offer one another. Though Aquarius will have a hard time admitting it (even to themselves), they’ll find Taurus’s solid base to be comfortingly supportive, and Taurus will find Aquarius stimulating, if not altogether comfortable.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Aquarius is ruled by Saturn (Karma) and Uranus (Rebellion). Venus is a warm, feminine energy and Saturn a cold masculine energy. Uranus is about all things strange and unusual. Venus focuses on beauty, romance and sensual pleasures, all of which are important and pleasing to Taurus. Saturn causes Aquarius to focus on hard work and discipline to achieve goals; Uranus lends an Aquarius that revolutionary thinking. Taurus can show Aquarius that life is based on emotions and improved by beauty and comfort. Aquarius can show Taurus how to keep striving for betterment — and how to move away from something if it isn’t working, an important lesson for Taurus to learn.</p><p>Taurus is an Earth Sign and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Aquarius focuses on intellectual connections and pursuits while Taurus focuses on more practical and sensual interests. Where Taurus asks, ‘How will this help me achieve my goals in life?’ Aquarius asks, ‘What else?’ These two can have trouble understanding one another; if Taurus clings too closely or if Aquarius seems too cold and aloof, trouble can erupt. If they operate from a base of mutual love and respect, however, these two can grow to understand how one another works.</p><p>Taurus and Aquarius are both Fixed Signs. They’re both stubborn and, once they make up their minds, don’t like to change their viewpoint or opinion. This steadfastness extends to their personal life: Once they’re committed to one another, almost nothing can make them decide to abandon the relationship. If the relationship is smooth and mutually beneficial, this is a good thing, but if the relationship is inhibitive for either or both partners, their refusal to admit it should end can seriously hamper both of their growth in life. If they realize that working together is more yielding than butting heads, they will remain productive. Since Taurus tends to be more practical, they might be the first to back down in an argument — if they deem it practical to do so.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Aquarius relationship? Their unstoppable team power that is possible once they clear their path of obstacles. Both Signs have very powerful personalities, so neither will dominate the other — no matter how hard they try! This relationship can be truly exciting and satisfying once these two Signs work out how it’ll work between them.</p>

								<p>When Taurus and Pisces come together in a love affair, it’s generally a happy union. They are two positions apart within the Zodiac, and such Signs tend to have karmic ties and a deep empathy for one another. While Pisces is idealistic, dreamy and impressionistic, Taurus is more down-to-earth and practical. They’re both nurturers, however, and both prize harmony and stability in a relationship.</p><p>These two Signs have much to offer one another. Taurus can provide the grounded approach Pisces needs to put all those dreams into action, and Pisces can offer the kindness, gentleness and sweet sympathy that Taurus so loves in a lover. At times, Taurus can’t understand Pisces’s seemingly simplistic life view; in reality, of course, Pisces isn’t simple at all. Still waters truly run deep, in this case.</p><p>Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter (Luck) and Neptune (Illusions). When Venus and Neptune meet, a beautiful spiritual connection is made. Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Together, they represent an idealistic relationship which borders on the divine. Jupiter adds its masculine energy to the combination; this Planet represents philosophy, expansion and excesses. These two Signs together can produce the kind of union both dream of; it may seem like heaven on Earth to both. The downside? This kind of heady, dreamy connection can be rooted in just that — dreams, illusions, fantasy.</p><p>Taurus is an Earth Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. These two Elements are generally quite compatible, as both Water and Earth are tangible, physical entities. Taurus can help Pisces stabilize their sensitivity, and Pisces can bring a touch of magic to Taurus’s practical approach. They should take care, though — too much of a good thing can turn Earth to mud. Taurus could tire of Pisces’s emotional instability, and Pisces may in turn feel that Taurus is insensitive to their needs. The good thing is, it’s generally easy for them to find a way to overcome their differences.</p><p>Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Where Taurus is steady, stubborn, practical and focused, Pisces likes the feeling of moving from one thought to the next according to fancy. Taurus’s rigidity can hamper Pisces’s flexibility; Taurus will need to learn to let Pisces flow. As a gift in return, Pisces will be a very supportive and loving partner. Pisces can show Taurus that mutability is sometimes better than a fixed determination to do things one way, and one way only.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Taurus-Pisces relationship? Their different emotional natures complement and harmonize with one another very well. The overall empathy and commitment these two Signs value in a relationship is what will keep the ties strong and long-lasting between the Bull and Fish.</p>

							<div id="gemini_gemini" class="hidden">
								<p>When two Geminis partner off, it really is like four people coming together (Gemini is represented by the Twins). This relationship can never be dull, which is a good thing — these two can get bored easily! Since they have the same need for intellectual stimulation and nearly-constant chatter, they serve very well as one another’s sounding boards off which to bounce new ideas and theories. Gemini is all about freedom and variety of expression, and two Geminis together will enjoy this to the fullest. Others enjoy two Geminis as a couple as well — they’re sure to be the life of every party with their sharp wit and well-honed entertainment routine. If they can avoid competition and cooperate instead, their love relationship can be extremely happy and mutually satisfying.</p><p>The Twins love to toss back and forth tidbits of playful banter, sarcasm and occasional ironic cynicism. This is fun, to be sure, but may prevent one or both of the partners from taking the relationship seriously! . In an intimate love relationship, there is certainly a place for seriousness, which Gemini would do well to learn. If both partners can pay more attention to their feelings rather than being ruled solely by thoughts and intellect, they will greatly enhance their love experience.</p><p>Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communication). This couple could talk each other around in circles all night long. Mercury (or Hermes in Greek mythology) was a traveller; Gemini shares that love for variety in places and conversation topics. Be warned, two-headed Twins — the gift of gab could be misinterpreted as gossip. Learning to use the gift of communication in a positive way is key.</p><p>Gemini is an Air Sign, and thus responds to the world and to their romantic partner with a more rational than emotional focus. Their short attention spans cause them to burn out sometimes, but two Geminis together burn out at the same time! And, of course, that Gemini creativity will dream up a new scheme a moment later.</p><p>Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Their flexible, easy-going natures make the four of them a perfect couple. These two have mastered the art of compromise; two Mutable signs together can easily form a conflict-free union. Just about the only thing that may lead to a real argument is a discussion that has gone out of hand; luckily, Gemini quickly realizes the insignificance of proving a point — and of fighting in general.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Gemini-Gemini relationship? The enormous amount of intellectual energy and stimulation they provide one another. They are able to save one another from leading a mundane existence. Together they can entertain the world and accomplish more than either could alone.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="gemini_cancer" class="hidden">
								<p>When Gemini and Cancer come together in a love affair, it may be a rather curious relationship. Sensitive, emotional Cancer has trouble communicating clearly, but clear communication is what defines Gemini. Gemini’s chivalrous nature and silver tongue may encourage the Crab to come out of its shell more quickly than usual; Cancer, in turn, can teach Gemini to slow down and appreciate the world, which the frenetic Twins hardly ever take time to do. If Gemini seems to ignore Cancer or doesn’t provide them with as much reassurance and intimacy as Cancer needs, trouble may ensue. These two Signs approach the world in such different manners that they must be able to understand and accept one another’s differences.</p><p>Cancer is the Sign of home and hearth, while Gemini is the thinker. Gemini can easily slip into the role of Cancer’s knight in shining armor; Cancer returns that favor with their characteristic urge to protect the ones they love. Quality of home life is important to Cancer, and Gemini will be spoiled by their Cancer lover’s hearty home cooking, soft bed and other creature comforts. Cancer is strongly intuitive and maintains an almost psychic connection with their loved ones, but can tend toward possessiveness and idealization of their Gemini partner. If Gemini just reassures Cancer that they’re loved and cherished, all will go smoothly.</p><p>Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communication) and Cancer is ruled by the Moon (Emotions). Cancer tends to keep their emotions bottled up inside as they have trouble expressing themselves. They envy Geminis their gift of open, clear communication afforded by the influence of Mercury. Gemini, in turn, can benefit from Cancer’s intuitive approach, so different from Gemini’s bubbly, surface nature; Cancer can teach Gemini to slow down and appreciate life instead of passing by the good things in their rush to get to the next new thing.</p><p>Gemini is an Air Sign and Cancer is a Water Sign. If these two Signs can work together they can be a great team; after all, the best decisions are made by incorporating the emotions and the intellect. The trouble for these two lies in learning to cooperate. They come from such opposite points of view that at times it can seem as if they simply have nothing in common. Deep, emotional Cancer can also sometimes dampen Gemini’s airy enthusiasm, and light, fast-paced Gemini can leave Cancer feeling ruffled, even tattered. Balance can be achieved if they learn to talk openly with one another.</p><p>Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Cancer is a Cardinal Signs. Gemini is flexible, willing to go with the flow and follow another’s lead; Cancer is an initiator and likes to provide that lead. Gemini may try to lead by being brave, even confrontational; for it to run smoothly between these two, they both need to learn when to back down and let the other lead the way.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Gemini-Cancer relationship? Once they realize they’re allies, they can soar to great heights together. Gemini is always thinking ahead and Cancer is quietly supporting these ideas behind the scenes. Each partner’s ability to provide what the other is lacking makes theirs a fulfilling relationship.</p>

							<div id="gemini_leo" class="hidden">
								<p>When Gemini and Leo come together in a love affair, their relationship is playful and high-spirited, characterized by light activity and optimism. Gemini thrives on mental stimulation and is therefore very attracted to Leo’s creative, dramatic spirit. There can be trouble between these two, however: If Leo takes Gemini’s flirty, outgoing nature too seriously, or if Gemini thinks Leo wants to maintain total control of the relationship, arguments may break out. Though their approaches are different — Gemini likes to analyze things from all sides in an intellectual conversation while Leo would rather not talk about it and just jump right in — they are well-matched.</p><p>Both Leo and Gemini have a lot of energy. Leo likes to be at the helm of any project, endeavor or outing; Gemini wants to be free to think as fast and as far as they please. Direct, decisive Leo can help Gemini make a decision if they start to vacillate due to their ability to see all the options — but Leo must take care not to be too bossy, which will turn Gemini off.</p><p>Leo is ruled by the Sun (Self) and Gemini by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Both of these Signs are skilled at communication as their planetary influences are similar; they just have different approaches to self-expression. They may also have heated debates, but while Gemini finds it fun and mentally stimulating, Leo takes it quite seriously and can get their feelings very hurt.</p><p>Gemini is an Air Sign and Leo is a Fire Sign. Air fuels Fire and helps it spread far and wide. Gemini has an easy time of keeping up with Leo’s energy and creativity. Leo tends to be dramatic and demonstrative, and brainy Gemini always understands Leo’s message. The best thing is, Leo can have an energetic, active day — and then come home at night and tell Gemini all about it.</p><p>Leo is a Fixed Sign and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Leo is stubborn and resolute, a great leader and somewhat rigid when it comes to changing their ideas or direction. When Leo makes up their mind, they’ll see something through to the end. Gemini, on the other hand, is flexible in the extreme. They become bored easily and have no problem letting Leo take the lead — to a certain extent. Gemini wants to be the leader of their own thoughts. They’re happy to be in the background, content with their thoughts while Leo takes the spotlight and the glory.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Gemini-Leo relationship? Their youthful, even childlike view of the world. This couple can be a great success due to their optimism and explorative natures.</p>

							<div id="gemini_virgo" class="hidden">
								<p>When Gemini and Virgo come together in a love affair, it’s crucial to the survival of the relationship that they take time to learn about one another’s approach to life and love — and remember that both partners’ attitudes are worth understanding! Gemini is symbolized by the Twins; they can see both sides of a story, they tend to vacillate between two courses of action and sometimes they can seem as if they have a split personality! This relationship is greatly strengthened when steady Virgo provides one Twin with a steady emotional anchor while allowing the other Twin to flit about at will. Virgo may be a bit too serious and demanding for Gemini, especially if this occurs early in the relationship before Gemini has fully committed. If Virgo just gives it time, things will smooth out.</p><p>Virgo and Gemini’s approaches to life are seemingly so different that mutual acceptance can be hard to come by — especially since Virgo tends to be so critical and exacting. Gemini strains against! Virgo’s ultra-practical stance in the world, and Virgo tires quickly of Gemini’s flighty ways. They do have much to teach one another, however. Virgo can help Gemini to be more involved in life and to see the depth of ideas rather than simply the surface. Gemini can help bring fun and excitement into Virgo’s life.</p><p>Both Signs are ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Gemini represents the masculine aspect of Mercury, Virgo the feminine (Mercury itself is androgynous). Virgo wants a dependable partner and therefore uses the penchant for clear communication toward forming the perfect relationship. Gemini is more intellectually focused than Virgo but does have a gift in relating to others.</p><p>Virgo is an Earth Sign and Gemini is an Air Sign. Virgo is practical, direct and precise. Virgo asks, ‘How will this help me achieve my goals in life?’ while Gemini, who moves through life relying on their mind, doesn’t waste time focusing on where they’re headed, but rather simply goes where their mind leads. Virgo’s fussy, critical nature and Gemini’s aloof detachment and capriciousness can cause trouble for both partners. Virgo must understand that Gemini’s flirtatious nature does not affect their feelings regarding the relationship, and Gemini must help to foster that understanding through words and deeds.</p><p>Virgo and Gemini are both Mutable Signs. Both are quite flexible; both are able to adapt to change at a moment’s notice. Both can be somewhat wishy-washy, however, Gemini due to their incessant intellectual ruminations and Virgo due to their penchant for analysis rather than action.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Gemini-Virgo relationship? The security they can give each other — once Virgo allows Gemini to commit willingly to the relationship. As long as they communicate with each other and use their Mercury powers effectively, theirs will be a gratifying relationship.</p>

							<div id="gemini_libra" class="hidden">
								<p>When Gemini and Libra come together in a love affair, they enjoy a great relationship based on intellectual interests and mental agility. Dual-natured Gemini loves Libra’s balance, and Libra is always entertained by the chatty, brainy Twins. Libra loves art and beauty while Gemini loves the beauty of an idea, but these loves aren’t far off from one another.</p><p>Both Gemini and Libra have a great deal of mental energy. They can come up with all sorts of great ideas when they work together, and Libra has the get-up-and-go needed to put their ideas into action, a quality which Gemini tends to lack. In fact, in the birth of an idea Gemini is better at pontification than direction, but this is a valuable contribution to Libra’s mental process. Both Signs share a need for intellectual freedom, which they can certainly provide for one another.</p><p>Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Gemini by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Libra and Gemini work well together; they combine the forces of love and communication. As Libra prizes harmony with their lover almost above all else, Gemini won’t be able to indulge their love of a good, hearty debate too often; Libra would rather do almost anything than argue.</p><p>Both Libra and Gemini are Air Signs. Gemini loves Libra’s energy and has no trouble keeping up when Libra is off and running with a new idea, art project or other pursuit. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, giving them great material for provocative discussion.</p><p>Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Libra is a Cardinal Sign. Libra likes a position of leadership in a relationship. They most often come up with the date ideas, for example, and flexible Gemini’s happy to go along — as long as it’s okay to change their minds at the last minute. Libra tends to initiate things but has trouble finishing them; Gemini is so adaptable, they won’t mind switching gears on a moment’s notice and moving on to something else if Libra gets bored.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Gemini-Libra relationship? Their ability to work together as an intellectual team. Together they can expose each other to new and different points of view and areas of interest, and help one another open up their worlds.</p>

							<div id="gemini_scorpio" class="hidden">
								<p>When Gemini and Scorpio come together in a love affair, they’ll need to learn to understand and accept one another’s differences — and if they can, they will be a nearly unbreakable couple. Where Gemini is adaptable, intellectual, outgoing and chatty, Scorpio tends to be secretive, focused, intense and determined. Gemini tends to take things lightly, including their lover; Scorpio, on the other hand, has a very deep need for emotional connection and intimacy. Scorpio is generally very loyal to their lover and very connected to the relationship.</p><p>This relationship tends to be highly passionate and can often be characterized by arguments; Gemini loves a good debate, considering it the epitome of mental stimulation, and that characteristic Gemini flirtatiousness tends to grate on Scorpio’s jealous, possessive nerves. Despite these differences, however, this is no dull relationship. Both Signs love to take chances and spice it up! They have lots of adventures together, but if things get too tense and arguments start to turn negative, they must make the effort to reconcile if they value the relationship and want it to last.</p><p>Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communication) and Scorpio is dually ruled by the Planets Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power). Scorpio is generally quite concerned with sexual and emotional intimacy; they need much reassurance that their lover values the relationship as much as they do. Thank goodness, then, for Gemini’s excellent communicative abilities; the Twins should have no trouble communicating their dedication to the Scorpion — if it’s dedication they feel. Gemini can’t and won’t fake a commitment they don’t feel, so intense Scorpio must learn to back off a bit. Gemini will certainly make a commitment to a love relationship, but only if they’re free to do so on their own, not coerced into it.</p><p>Gemini is an Air Sign and Scorpio is a Water Sign. These two elements can be a great combination; after all, the best decisions are made when they incorporate the intellect (Air) and the emotions (Water) — the mind and the heart. The trick, of course, is getting these two elements to work in tandem. Scorpio is a master strategist; if there’s a decision to be made or a project at hand, they can help flighty Gemini focus on the best options. Gemini, in turn, teaches Scorpio to let go and move on when their efforts are thwarted. There is a downside to these two elements’ union, however; Scorpio’s emotional manipulations can prove to dampen Gemini’s natural energy and enthusiasm. Also, airy Gemini can leave Scorpio’s deep waters feeling choppy, rough and disturbed.</p><p>Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Gemini tends to do things on a whim, just for the experience, contrary to Scorpio, who almost always has a plan (or an ulterior motive) in mind. Scorpio can use their focus and determination to help teach Gemini the value in finishing things before jumping headlong into the next experience. Once these two begin to understand that they can enjoy a satisfying relationship — Gemini providing the reasoning and brain power and Scorpio bringing their healthy dollop of sex appeal, emotionalism and passion — they can enjoy a truly mutually satisfying relationship.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Gemini-Scorpio relationship? The strength they have when they function as a unit. They are both winners who refuse to give up, making theirs a relationship that never settles for second best.</p>

							<div id="gemini_sagittarius" class="hidden">
								<p>When Gemini and Sagittarius come together in a love affair, it can be a truly spectacular match! These two are extremely compatible; any rough spots they encounter during the course of the relationship are sure to be smoothed over with a minimum of effort. Gemini is quite able to provide pioneering, adventurous Sagittarius with the independence Sagittarius requires in a close relationship, because Gemini shares that same need. While Sagittarius needs physical independence, Gemini needs mental freedom, but the need is the same at base. These two both love new experiences, people and sensations, and are sure to have great adventures together. Both have attention spans that love to move quickly from one thing to the next in order to absorb as much experience as possible.</p><p>Gemini and Sagittarius are great friends, besides being well-matched lovers. They share a deep understanding and a very similar life view, based on a general, refreshing optimism and enthusiasm. Sagittarius can sometimes be a bit too blunt, saying things without thinking beforehand about whether they’ll hurt someone or not, but Gemini is a hardy sort and, like Sagittarius, can forgive and forget quickly. These two don’t have time or the interest required to hold a grudge.</p><p>Gemini is ruled by Mercury (Communication) and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (Luck). Mercury lends Gemini their chatty, intellectual demeanor; Jupiter is about both luck and philosophy, and lends Sagittarius their constant questing for knowledge and truth. This is a great match — Gemini comes up with a new idea and Sagittarius jumps right on, ready to explore it to its limits.</p><p>Gemini is an Air Sign and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. This is quite the active relationship! Air spreads Fire far and wide, helping it increase in power. Gemini and Sagittarius together have just this effect on one another. Theirs is a very fiery, passionate connection; there’s always something going on. Sometimes what’s going on escalates into a real argument and actually hurt feelings; these Signs are opposite one another in the Zodiac, which means they have quite a deep and complex connection. In other words, when it’s good it’s very, very good, but when it’s bad it can be terrible. These two may fight most about who’s in charge; they both have competitive streaks that can flare up at inopportune moments. The good thing is, although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don’t last long — Gemini is too busy moving on to the next challenge to hold a grudge, and Sagittarius can forgive anything but a lack of respect from their Gemini lover.</p><p>Gemini and Sagittarius are both Mutable Signs and are thus extremely compatible. They’re both flexible in the extreme, quite willing and able to adapt to change. This is a good thing; when Gemini changes their mind mid-thought, Sagittarius has no problem taking a 180-degree turn and keeping right up with their high-flying partner. When Sagittarius suddenly gets the travel bug, Gemini is very amiable about hopping in the car and going right along.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Gemini-Sagittarius relationship? Their mutual interest in cultivating knowledge, utilizing intellect and turning it into action. They are well-matched in their enthusiasm, energy and drive. Common interests and similar personalities make them a compatible couple.</p>

							<div id="gemini_capricorn" class="hidden">
								<p>When Gemini and Capricorn come together in a love affair, it may be tough for them to remember why they’re together at all, as the ways in which they approach the world couldn’t be more opposite. If they’re operating from a base of love and mutual respect, they’ll be able to overcome most obstacles, but they must work hard. Gemini must have freedom to think outside the bounds; they rely on their quick wits, humor and intellectual prowess to move through life at a fast pace. Capricorn is concerned with advancement and status; they rely on following the rules and finding set, tried-and-true paths to follow toward success, no matter how long it takes. Gemini likes to cut corners; Capricorn likes to be thorough. These two Signs’ challenge as a couple is to learn to maintain a similar pace so they can arrive at the same place at the same time.</p><p>Capricorn is very unassuming and quiet, which stands out even more against Gemini’s outgoing, boisterous nature. Capricorn tends to be slow, steady and stubborn while Gemini is flexible and tends to change their mind a lot. Gemini has a quick brain that sees loopholes in an instant, while Capricorn is tough to convince that taking advantage of a shortcut is a better idea than following the well-mapped course that they know will ensure their success. However, if these two can learn to understand and then implement one another’s approaches, they can achieve far more than they could alone. These two Signs may make much better business partners than they do lovers.</p><p>Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communication), Capricorn by the Planet Saturn (Power). These Planetary influences can oppose one another. Saturn has a cold, masculine energy; it’s all about perseverence and helps Capricorn keep moving ahead through all kinds of difficulties. Mercury has an androgynous energy and lends Gemini their gift of intellect and communication. Neither of these Signs will give up easily, but together they may cause one another to repress their natural emotions. Gemini already tends to skim lightly on the surface of emotions, choosing to take their love life as lightly as they take most things in life. Capricorn may dampen Gemini’s enthusiastic spirit if both Signs don’t take care to maintain their boundaries and allow one another to do the same.</p><p>Gemini is an Air Sign and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. Capricorn is practical, steady and efficient. They see no need to take risks if they aren’t guaranteed to pay off. Gemini, on the other hand, is theoretical and analytical; they are all about risk-taking and following wherever their inventive ideas may lead. While Capricorn is buys asking, ‘What good will this do as I work toward my main plan in life?’ Gemini simply moves with the flow according to no set plan.</p><p>Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign. Capricorn initiates things; they like to be in control. Gemini is more flexible, generally happy to follow Capricorn’s lead — as long as they aren’t forced into anything. They need to feel free to agree, disagree and choose at will, and if they begin to feel coerced, they will respond by becoming aloof and inaccessible. If these two value their relationship and want it to last, they must learn to compromise and let one another off the hook from time to time, so to speak.</p><p>Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign.

							<div id="gemini_aquarius" class="hidden">
								<p>When Gemini and Aquarius come together in a love affair, the pair can enjoy a wonderfully stimulating mental connection. Gemini is in love with ideas, and visionary Aquarius is full of them. Both of these Signs need their independence; they can easily provide this for one another since they understand the need so well. The only trouble that may arise is if Gemini begins to think Aquarius is too stubborn in their thinking, or if Gemini dawdles a bit too much for Aquarius’s fast-paced, forward-moving standards. This type of problem isn’t likely to cause a major disturbance; in general they work very well together and understand one another on a very deep level.</p><p>Both Gemini and Aquarius have a great deal of energy. Both their minds are so quick they can easily come up with newer and better ideas and, with Aquarius’s determination at the helm, put their ideas to action. They both rely on their quick wits, especially Gemini, and both Signs abhor wasting time. Aquarius can help Gemini focus if they begin to waver, but must take care to allow Gemini plenty of mental space and freedom. Gemini doesn’t like to feel crowded or pushed into anything.</p><p>Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn (Karma) and Uranus (Rebellion), and Gemini by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Saturn and Uranus combine their powers to lend Aquarius their progressive, original mind and the determination to put their ideas to good use. Aquarius is the great humanitarian of the Zodiac. Gemini is a great thinker and conversationalist, and can easily help out if Aquarius gets stuck on an idea and needs a little mental shove. Gemini’s more flexible mind can greatly aid Aquarius in times of tension or rigidity.</p><p>Both Aquarius and Gemini are Air Signs. Their intellectual bond is strong and true. They’re both quite social by nature; Gemini is witty and chatty, in love with impressing people with that quick and agile brain, and Aquarius loves all sorts of people. The more different kinds of people Aquarius knows, the better Aquarius feels in life. Both Signs’ interests are multiple and wide-ranging. Gemini’s penchant for good talks and debates is satisfied by the many experiences these two Signs are likely to share.</p><p>Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Gemini likes free flow; they prize independence and are very adaptable to change. Aquarius, on the other hand, is much more determined, even stubborn, and generally likes to take the lead in this relationship.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Gemini-Aquarius relationship? Their ability to work together and provide one another with a sounding board for inspirations and flights of fancy. Their successful verbal interaction makes theirs a healthy relationship.</p>

							<div id="gemini_pisces" class="hidden">
								<p>When Gemini and Pisces come together in a love affair, they can make a very empathetic and mutually satisfying couple. Gemini is cerebral, quick-witted and silver-tongued, and can bring a dash of humor and intellectual direction to help focus Pisces’s dreamy view of the world. Pisces has the gift of intuitive empathy; they connect very well with others on a rather subtle emotional level, and their dreamy nature makes them quite open-minded — in short, Pisces expects the unexpected. Gemini is open-minded as well; mentally both agile and flexible, the Twins are gifted at seeing all sides of an issue and at communicating with other people. This relationship is all about flexibility and connection.</p><p>Gemini and Pisces make great friends as well as lovers. Pisces is rather emotionally sensitive and can get their feelings hurt when brash Gemini speaks without thinking. But even when they do have problems, these partners can forgive and forget easily. Neither Sign sees any reason to hold a grudge, Pisces because they understand their partner’s true intentions, and Gemini because they simply don’t have the time to dwell on past hurts.</p><p>Gemini is ruled by Mercury (Communication) and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter (Luck) and Neptune (Illusion). Jupiter, about learning and philosophy as well as luck, lends Pisces their desire to know more deeply, and Neptune makes Pisces so dreamy. Mercury is all about quick wit, innovation and invention — Gemini’s watch words. Pisces is able to understand Gemini’s frequent new ideas on a deeply intuitive level.</p><p>Gemini is an Air Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. The combination of an intellectual focus with an emotional, intuitive grasp of the world makes decisions much more solid; if these two can work together, they can achieve much. Their only trouble is the communication breakdowns that can result if Pisces feels Gemini isn’t understanding enough, or if Gemini feels hampered by Pisces’s emotional sensitivity. The good thing is, both try to get over their own hurt feelings quickly.</p><p>Gemini and Pisces are both Mutable Signs, thus quite compatible. Both Signs are adaptable, flexible and very able to deal with change. They also tend to change their own minds quite a bit, so it’s a good thing they’re both so open-minded. Neither Sign needs to take the lead, and they both provide one another with plenty of space and freedom.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Gemini-Pisces relationship? Their mutual interest in cultivating their knowledge and utilizing their intellect. They are well-matched in their flexibility. Their shared interests and similar personalities make theirs a very companionable relationship.</p>

								<p>When two Cancerians come together in a love affair, a loving and yet very emotional domestic relationship ensues. A Cancer-Cancer match makes for a deeply devoted duo, endlessly loyal to one another. Both will learn the ins-and-outs of their partner, the best ways to heat each other up or, if necessary, to cool one another down. Both will also find great comfort and satisfaction in their underlying commitment to one another. This couple is faithful and caring, helpful and sympathetic of individual needs and very oriented toward making a home and creating a sense of family — especially when they can get over their brooding, manipulative and self-pitying habits. If they can find a way to keep their fluid and moody emotions in check, this relationship will nurture both lovers.</p><p>A Cancer’s place is in the home. Once safely entrenched in their personal sanctuary, the moody Crab may forget about the world outside, not paying mind to the opinions of others, only concerned with what’s going on behind their own closed doors. This attitude carries over into relationships: Like their cherished possessions and material comforts, Cancer never hesitates to defend a loved one if threatened. This devotion and willingness to fight and toil for the survival and success of their relationships are really a Crab’s greatest contributions to the game of love. It’s no wonder Cancer’s symbol is the ‘crabby’ scuttling Crab, for outbursts and flare-ups are common with this emotional crustacean. While their mood swings may injure each other’s feelings, it’s a Cancer’s subtle mastery of the fine art of emotional manipulation that one should watch out for.</p><p>The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and this Sign is sensitive to the moods that ebb and flow with the Moon’s monthly cycles. The Moon, the maternal orb of the heavens, is the celestial force behind Cancer’s great maternal and care-giving nature. The energy of this instinct creates a warm, secure home environment, a perfect love nest for the growing and cultivation of a healthy relationship.</p><p>Cancer is a Water Sign. Instinct and emotion drive this relationship. With these deep, intense intuitive powers comes a fragility, as Cancer’s feelings are brittle and easily hurt. Hence, that Crabby shell in which they hide themselves when frightened or overwhelmed. So often retreating to their shells can put a strain on any relationship with a Cancer, but two Crabs together will hopefully be perceptive of each other’s needs for personal space and temporary time-outs. The key is realizing that it’s not a personal slight if one of these Cancers wants some alone-time. This Watery element of their nature can protect them and their loved ones from the harsh realities of the outside world.</p><p>Cancer is a Cardinal Sign. Though not the most physically active of the Signs, a Cancer’s quick emotional reflexes and powers of perception offer an alternate line of defense under stress. The Crab is not shy about getting exactly what they want from their partner. The protecting feral beast within is the first emotional element to leap forward under stress or a threat to the pack. However, these bursts of emotion may overwhelm a Cancer and crush their tender feelings. Fierce loyalty binds this Cancer-Cancer love match, but it can also threaten its very existence. Both partners must always strive to see things from their lover’s point of view as well as their own.</p><p>What’s the best thing about the Cancer-Cancer love match? Their utter devotion to enriching their commitment and the strong emotional bond between them. Together, this pair will protect one another and keep their love safe from the outside world, as well as work toward creating a happy domestic life and nurturing a loving family.</p>

							<div id="cancer_leo" class="hidden">
								<p>When Cancer and Leo make a love match, they understand and know how to satisfy basic emotional needs within one another. Both these Signs require dedication and tender, loving care, but while Cancer seeks stability and emotional harmony, Leo craves heartfelt compliments and sincere admiration. Both are strongly loyal, even to the point of possessiveness, Cancer for safety’s sake, Leo for the sake of their self-confidence. They are also both committed to a enduring, rewarding connection. Since their desires are similar, a Cancer and a Leo may fill very important voids in each other’s lives.</p><p>Both Leo and Cancer prefer comfort and security, and they prefer both on a grand scale. Cancer and Leo enjoy a lovely home and a close-knit family. Leo provides the flair and the passion, and Cancer brings to the home a sensitive but intense instinct to nurture. Leo is the bigger and bolder and more vivid of this couple, the picture of majesty and status. Because both Signs are so strong-minded, these two must always work attentively to understand and accept one another.</p><p>The intense and emotional Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, while the bright, bold Sun (the Self) rules Leo. The Sun is about ego and self, radiating warmth and light, and vibrant Leo indeed radiates this kind of energy and enthusiasm. The Moon concerns itself with nurturing, with creating and maintaining emotional connections. This combination of masculine and feminine energy is why the Sun and the Moon adore and sustain one another other as they do. The Sun represents life, and The Moon cultivation and growth; as long as they are mindful of their inherent differences, their combination can be a positive one.</p><p>Cancer is a Water Sign, and Leo is a Fire Sign. Leo strives with an ardent energy toward praise and appreciation, while Cancer yearns more for security and stability. Both Signs like to take charge, but they come at a leadership role from very different directions. No small number of disputes can rise from this difference. As long as Cancer and Leo never take for granted their relationship, as long as they reassure one another in practical and romantic ways that this relationship is important to both of them, they can usually find a happy medium.</p><p>Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Leo is a Fixed Sign. Under stress, Leo becomes opinionated and stubborn, and Cancer can act as a subtle manipulative force. Cancer’s the persistent initiator of shared plans, and Leo channels their energies and works doggedly to move plans to completion. If given the choice, the Crab would choose a calm and stable life, having no need for glamour or acclaim. Leo, on the other hand, loves to shake things up and embraces the unexpected and the novel. Though a Leo and a Cancer may commit emotionally to a relationship, each of them can continue to follow their natural instincts AND devote themselves thoroughly and completely to one another. If, however, they haven’t made their love intentions clear to one another, they may find themselves on a never-ending emotional roller coaster ride. Cancer, hiding behind that innocent shell of theirs, can be the more quietly controlling of this pair and might — to a degree — manipulate their Leo loved one when it seems practical to do so.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Cancer-Leo relationship? Their mutual commitment to a sincere relationship. Together this pair can share a supportive, positive and healthy vibe. People see them as a winning combination, and their mutual desire for a secure, loving relationship makes them strive for harmony.</p>

							<div id="cancer_virgo" class="hidden">
								<p>When Cancer and Virgo make a love match, a strong, down-to-earth relationship with staying power is the happy result. This is a relationship with great potential to get better and better over the passing years. Both Cancer and Virgo are goal-oriented and disciplined. They are sincere and devoted to one another and share a strong sense of purpose. No lightweight love here: These two were not really built for flings! Cancer and Virgo deeply admire one another: Virgo respects Cancer’s quiet strength and dedication while Cancer appreciates Virgo’s keen adaptability and intelligence.</p><p>These lovers may get off to a slow start, but over time, bonds will only grow stronger. The Cancer-Virgo love match prides itself on common sense and strong principles over fluff and inconsequential or fleeting connections. They enjoy the material comforts of life, but they will only feel good about their bounty if it has come as a result of honest hard work. There could be tiffs if Virgo becomes too critical for Cancer’s easily bruised feelings; Cancer needs to understand that it’s just Virgo’s nature to point out what they observe, that it’s not a personal attack. A Virgo may bristle at their Cancer mate’s stubborn streak, but it’s a trait that a patient and understanding love partner like Virgo could come to appreciate. Also, Virgo’s urge to serve suits Cancer’s affectionate, nurturing nature well.</p><p>The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and Mercury (Communication) rules Virgo. Though they’re very different planets, they’re both near the Sun and therefore always in one another’s neighborhoods. The Moon is a mothering influence; it’s about cultivation and fostering growth, which are both central concerns for Cancer. Mercury is all about communication, and it’s an androgynous energy — Virgo will adapt and take on the form that it chooses, the guise that best serves a situation. Virgo takes an intellectual approach to life (especially compared to the emotional Cancer), but still manages to be perceptive and intuitive enough to figure others out if they choose. Good thing for the Crab, then, that a Virgo mate can get a feel for devotion and domestic fulfillment if that’s what their Cancer lover desires. These two won’t argue about fulfilling one another’s needs. They’ll work at it and relish the rewards of their conscientiousness.</p><p>Cancer is a Water Sign, and Virgo is an Earth Sign. Earth Signs, true to their name, are down-to-earth, but they can also be materialistic and preoccupied with acquisition. The Cancer-Virgo love partners like to surround themselves with comfortable, well-crafted things. Water Signs rely on feeling and intuition, making Cancer the emotive force behind this relationship, in a subtle Cancer way, of course. Along with their desire for prosperity, their love of a fancy home life ensures that this couple will work hard toward this shared goal. Also, they’re practical pair, and losing control is never really an issue.</p><p>Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Virgo is a Mutable Sign. While Cancer gets things going, Virgo thrives on a changing routine of responsibilities and challenges. Because they’re so ubiquitous, Virgo will find a place in Cancer’s plans if they really want to. Virgo will keep in mind Cancer’s plans, and will eventually bring results even if Cancer has moved on.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of Cancer-Virgo relationship? Their dedication to working toward the same goals. Both partners in this love match enjoy a stable home life and nice things, and Virgo truly enjoys helping Cancer along the way to achieving their goals. Their shared goals and desires make theirs a highly compatible love match.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="cancer_libra" class="hidden">
								<p>When Cancer and Libra make a love match, they give to one another important things that each lacks. Both Signs seek a secure, assured relationship and will enjoy their shared appreciation for beauty and luxury — especially when it comes to their domestic environment. These two can blend their energies harmoniously if they choose to work toward a common goal. Though this pairing may progress more slowly than some others, and at first they may fear that they have little else in common than their mutual needs for companionship and love of beauty. However, the more they get to know one another, the better each individual in this Cancer-Libra love match will recognize and respect positive qualities in the other.</p><p>Neither Cancer nor Libra shy away from combining the powers of their emotion and their intellect, and both enjoy the occasional teary opera or sentimental heirloom. Expression of sentiment and happiness are important to both Signs, and Cancer and Libra can complement one another in many ways. Cancer appreciates Libra’s charm and tact, and Libra’s calm, cool diplomacy skills can tame even the wildest pouting fit a Cancer can muster up. Also, Libra, lover of aesthetic beauty and harmony, will appreciate their Cancer mate’s nurturing instinct for a comfortable home and the security that comes with it. Libra can offer the sometimes emotionally impetuous Cancer some perspective on situations. Cancer needs to see the different sides of an issue, or this Crab may be prone to making decisions without knowing all the facts. Conversely, Cancer can help Libra cure their notorious indecision.</p><p>The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and the Planet Venus (Love) rules Libra. These planetary partners share a love of home, family and romance. While Libra is known for its balancing nature (the Balance is Libra’s symbol, after all!), these love partners share nurturing personalities and desire harmony over conflict. More than any other match-up of Signs, this astrological pair brings a warmth and sense of stability to those around them. Despite all the harmony and homey happiness, though, Librans, whose life approach is based on intellect, can be a bit snobbish and superior, and Cancer, who looks at life through emotional lenses, still has those easily bruised feelings to contend with.</p><p>Cancer is a Water Sign, and Libra is an Air Sign. Libra sees life as a pure mental exploration, while Cancer’s experience is more tactile, more kinesthetic. Cancer is most satisfied when their emotional needs are met, while Libra simply focuses on what stimulates their mind. At times, these lovers may find it difficult to understand one another. Conflicts can arise in this relationship if Cancer seems too crabby or Libra seems too provocative. Both need to learn that they simply view the world in different ways.</p><p>Cancer and Libra are both Cardinal Signs. In this relationship, there could be struggles over who wears the pants, who’s at the steering wheel, who’s really in control here. If Libra’s indecision irritates Cancer, Libra can turn on their subtle charm and sense of fairness and go along with Cancer’s decision — as long as Cancer doesn’t get Crabby! Both are initiators, which can, when their ideas and approaches differ, be quite a struggle.</p><p>What’s the best thing about the Cancer-Libra love match? Their mutual appreciation of stability and domestic balance. Aesthetics matter to them, and they share a love of the comforts in life. Their similar tastes and loves make theirs a relationship of great dedication and harmony.</p>

							<div id="cancer_scorpio" class="hidden">
								<p>When Cancer and Scorpio make a love match, the resulting relationship draws together the energies of two emotionally intense Signs. Signs such as these often combine well, each partner’s strengths balancing the other’s weaknesses. These Signs feel a strong sexual attraction, and when they are together the temperature in the room tends to rise! Cancer and Scorpio have a great deal in common, and much potential to keep their relationship passionate and going strong.</p><p>Cancer and Scorpio enjoy buying things together and creating a comfortable living space: Cancer craves security and Scorpio strives for power. Both occupy their minds with thoughts of domestic goods and resources, including stocks, bonds and inheritances. Since they are both concerned with the home and have fierce loyalties to the family group, Cancer and Scorpio complement each other well. They both see life as a passionate and deeply emotionally exercise of human connection.</p><p>The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, while Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power) both rule Scorpio. Thanks to Pluto’s powerful influence, this is an intense combination of Planets, but it’s also a good balance of masculine and feminine energy. These two Signs coming together form the basic foundation of human relationships — The Moon’s nurturing love and Mars’ ambition and passion. The Moon and Mars go well together; the Moon is about growth and rebirth, and Mars is about the passion of romance. Scorpio, influenced by that Martian energy, is smoldering and intense, and emotional Cancer is attracted to this intensity. In turn, Scorpio enjoys the adoration inherent to Moon-ruled, nurturing Cancer.</p><p>Cancer and Scorpio are both Water Signs. Both are very deep Signs and, like the ocean, you can never really see to the bottom of these two. Scorpio and Cancer may draw further and further into themselves, then suddenly roar back with intimidating force. Loyalty is strong with this love match, thanks to their mutual desire for emotional security. But while Cancer fixes their emotional energy on the family and home, Scorpio focuses more on life’s nuances and undertones, the secrets behind other’s intentions, the power they can wield over other’s emotions. Scorpio can take Cancer on a journey beyond the literal surface of things, and Cancer’s expansive heart can open Scorpio up to their own emotions, teaching their Scorpio mate that feeling is nothing to fear. Additionally, Scorpio appreciates their Cancer mate’s practicality, and Cancer really enjoys Scorpio’s jealousy — it proves that Scorpio really loves and cherishes them.</p><p>Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Once this couple have a common wish, it will come true. However, if their opinions clash, look out! Cancer will be the first to instigate an argument and Scorpio the last to finish it. Cancer may seem to act as the dominant partner and manage to get their way more often, but that isn’t always the truth. Sometimes Scorpio won’t even agree to disagree, they just might pretend to give in. Neither Cancer nor Scorpio are beyond using emotional manipulation to get revenge. Rather than letting disagreements and bad feelings boil over, these love partners must discuss what’s truly important to them in order to reach an equitable compromise. Once Scorpio and Cancer learn to trust and believe in one another, they can achieve almost anything through sheer determination. This love relationship will only fail if the two partners truly cannot overcome their opinionated, stubborn sides.</p><p>What’s the best thing about the Cancer-Scorpio love match? Their powerful teamwork when they agree on their goals. When Cancer realizes that Scorpio is there for the long haul and that the partnership is emotionally productive, this relationship can blossom. Their mutual determination makes theirs a relationship of formidable strength.</p>

							<div id="cancer_sagittarius" class="hidden">
								<p>When Cancer and Sagittarius make a love match, they both need to be patient and give the relationship time to grow and mature. As it develops, each love partner will discover that they have much to offer one another. At first, it just seems like Sagittarius is the thrill seeker who enjoys the occasional adrenaline rush, and that Cancer derives much more satisfaction from emotional security. Early in the relationship, Cancer may want more of a commitment than Sagittarius is willing to give. But as time goes by, Sagittarius will learn to appreciate the strong emotional support that Cancer offers.</p><p>These two lovers, Cancer and Sagittarius, have different approaches to life; Cancer lives on emotion and tradition, and Sagittarius is the restless wanderer. Cancer’s emotional tidal wave can be difficult and overwhelming for Sagittarius to accept. And Cancer might be resistant to accepting their Sagittarian mate’s restlessness and craving for external activities. A Cancer partner can offer a Sagittarius a secure home base, a place where Sag can go to keep their dreams and ambitions in perspective. The Sagittarius free spirit can lend Cancer’s daily life a little diversity and excitement.</p><p>The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and Jupiter (Philosophy) rules Sagittarius. The Moon is about love, nurturing and the maternal instinct. Jupiter focuses on expansion, optimism, luck and travel. Together this is combination of growth and expansion and of masculine and feminine energy; the two can sustain each other. When working toward a common goal, these two can combine their energies to great effect.</p><p>Cancer is a Water Sign, and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. Sagittarius desires freedom, while Cancer longs for emotional security and stability, and these basic needs color their approach to life, to projects and to relationships. One lover may not always get where the other lover is coming from, but when they put their complementary energies together, sparks can fly and dreams can come true. If they value their intimate connection and their friendship and respect one another’s opinions, their conflicts can usually be resolved.</p><p>Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Sagittarius moves from idea to idea and venture to venture as the feeling takes them, while Cancer is the instigator of new plans. A Cancer mate must give their Sagittarius lover the freedom to explore their own space and interests external to the relationship. Cancer can bring Sagittarius’ great ideas to life, even if Sagittarius has lost interest and moved on. Sagittarius teaches Cancer the virtues of an open mind over constant and inflexible determination.</p><p>What’s the best part of the Cancer-Sagittarius love match? The security they can give one another (once Cancer gives Sagittarius the freedom to offer that security freely). They make a compatible couple once they open themselves up to one another and accept as valid each other’s differing life philosophies. If the lines of communication remain open and clear, and as long as these two take time to appreciate and celebrate their differences, theirs will be a stable and happy relationship.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="cancer_capricorn" class="hidden">
								<p>When Cancer and Capricorn make a love match, it’s a celestial pairing of great tenacity and determination. Capricorn, the Sea Goat, is focused on logic, on being down-to-earth and real; Cancer brings a charge of emotional intensity to the relationship. Both hold one another to high standards tempered by an abiding mutual respect. In a Capricorn mate, Cancer finds dedication, and in return Capricorn comes to love Cancer’s persistence. These two Signs from opposite sides of the Zodiac can come together to create a very successful and secure connection.</p><p>This relationship builds and grows from a strong foundation of material and emotional security. Both Signs can be depended on to make frugal, conservative decisions. It doesn’t have to be all solemnity, though, as Cancer can help their hard-working Capricorn lover to relax a little at the end of the day, to take time to enjoy the rewards of all that labor. Cancer will also be the one to polish and preserve the fruits of their shared accomplishments; Cancer is the keeper of nostalgia and cherished memories and possessions. Capricorn moves Cancer toward achievement and keeps in check their Crab-like tendencies, enlightening Cancer to the more important matters of the world outside their own easily bruised heart. This relationship succeeds if there is an ironclad commitment and a stable, traditional home environment.</p><p>The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and Saturn (Karma) rules Capricorn. The Moon is a warm, feminine energy, and Saturn a cold, masculine energy. The Moon is emotional and nurturing; it is about maternal care giving and intuition, both of which become vital to Cancer. Saturn practices integrity and discipline to achieve goals. A Cancer love mate can show their serious Capricorn companion how to enjoy life and to appreciate beauty and comfort. Mothering Cancer truly enjoys smoothing over Capricorn’s hard edges. Conversely, the Sea Goat can smooth Cancer’s ruffled emotional feathers by providing the sort of solid foundation that Cancer desperately craves. Capricorn teaches Cancer to be more disciplined and to go out into the world and strive toward goals.</p><p>Cancer is a Water Sign, and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. Earth Signs focus on possessions, Water Signs on emotion and intuition, but also on beauty and nostalgia. The Cancer-Capricorn love mates like to surround themselves with beautiful things — a stately home, gorgeous artwork, expensive cars. Their desire to be economically stable and their love of finery ensures that this couple will work hard toward this and other shared goals. This mutual love for fine things keeps them out of arguments about one partner trying to live ostentatiously or beyond their means.</p><p>Cancer and Capricorn are Cardinal Signs. Both are initiatory, active and ardent. Though this can be a catalyst for some dynamite conflicts, it can provide Capricorn with an emotional pillar, as Cancer is entirely dedicated to the relationship. Their differing emotional dispositions complement each other well — Capricorn excels in getting the nitty-gritty business done, and Cancer always steps in when emotional counseling is needed. These Signs will get along well if Capricorn and Cancer allow one another to use their respective individual strengths.</p><p>What’s the best thing about the Cancer-Capricorn relationship? Their utter dedication to one another and their mutual commitments toward shared goals. Both are lovers of quality and of beautiful, luxurious things, and neither shirks at the idea of a little hard work if that’s what it takes (in fact, Capricorn would rather be working than almost anything!). Their shared passions, sense of responsibility and morality make theirs a highly compatible relationship.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="cancer_aquarius" class="hidden">
								<p>When Cancer and Aquarius make a love match, it can be a case of opposites attracting. Cancer takes an emotional approach to life, Aquarius, an offbeat, unconventional approach. While Cancer often retreats into its shell, Aquarius takes every opportunity to be the extrovert, the organizer and party animal. They love to find themselves amongst friends; social settings are simply their thing! If a Cancer and an Aquarius can find a way to combine these qualities in a positive way, they can go anywhere together.</p><p>Both Cancer and Aquarius can be ambitious and determined. They want to get their way, and neither likes to conflict. Cancer can be old-fashioned, attached to tradition and routine, their morals more conservative than progressive. Aquarius, on the other hand, is very modern and likely numbed by routine, yawning at the dull and the boring in which Cancer sometimes finds comfort. Cancer may be intrigued by their Aquarius lover’s sense of excitement, but this traditional Crab could get frustrated trying to keep up with this revolutionary’s mind. Though Aquarius won’t appreciate the possessiveness of a pinching Crab, they could find great comfort in the solid base Cancer provides. Just try to get them to admit it!</p><p>The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and Saturn (Karma) and Uranus (Rebellion) rules Aquarius. The Moon is a radiant, feminine energy and Saturn is a cool, contained masculine energy. Uranus is about all things abnormal and novel. The Moon is emotional and concerned with growth and domesticity, both of which become central themes in many Cancer’s lives. Saturn deals with hard work and the discipline required for achievement, while Uranus symbolizes forward thought. This combination makes sense for an Aquarian, as they are futurists unafraid of getting their hands dirtied by labor. Cancer mates can teach social, intellectual Aquarius lovers the value of emotional impulses, and their feminine influence will bring beauty and comfort into the home. While Cancer teaches the valuable lesson of an open heart, Aquarius can come right back with the usefulness of a detached heart. Aquarians are blessed to be able to extricate themselves from uncontrollable situations and to reevaluate goals if they get off-course. Not necessarily cold, Aquarius could still benefit from Cancer’s warm, feminine Moon-based influence.</p><p>Cancer is a Water Sign, and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Aquarius sees life as an intellectual exercise, a constant exploration and expansion of the mind. Cancer’s more pragmatic. Cancer stops to ask, ‘how does this feel?’ while Aquarians keep asking ‘what else is there?’ It may be tough for one to get where the other is coming from, and conflicts can arise if Aquarius gets a little too cool or Cancer too emotionally demanding. They may end up working at cross-purposes: Cancer asks for more and more, Aquarius may pull further and further away. By accepting that their worldviews are dissimilar, Cancer and Aquarius can move on and celebrate their diversity, learn to say ‘vive la difference’ rather than feeling threatened by it.</p><p>Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Both persevere when working toward goals. If they have a set path, they’ll follow it to the end. With this sort of shared perseverance — and if they both place a high value on their relationship — this couple will never be dissuaded from that knowledge and will constantly think of one another. If they run into snags, Aquarius will discover that Cancers, though they may seem shy and retire into their shells, can actually be very tenacious and dogmatic, not above using emotional manipulation on their loved ones. Also, Aquarius could be bothered by Cancer’s over-emotionality. If they agree to work toward a common goal, these two can get along.</p><p>What’s the best thing about the Cancer-Aquarius love match? When they decide to come together, they are an indomitable force! When they decide to combine their disparate energies, Cancer and Aquarius can find their own natural balance and have fun with their differences rather than letting them frighten them away from a chance to love.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="cancer_pisces" class="hidden">
								<p>A love match between a Cancer and a Pisces is a positive meeting of spirits. Both signs are basically tolerant and sympathetic, and Pisces is easily energized by Cancer’s ideas. A Pisces mate can open a Cancer’s eyes to the world of creativity and spirituality. In turn, Cancer’s practicality can be a guide, leading Pisces to the fruition of their dreamy, utopian ideas. This celestial pairing benefits from an amazingly strong and multifaceted emotional bond.</p><p>Cancer loves material goods, they admire and they appreciate. Cancer desires comfort and a rich home, and at times might not understand the simplistic, minimalist lifestyle of their Pisces mate. Though they may work toward different goals of acquisition and lifestyle, the shared emotional depth of Cancer and Pisces can make theirs a very rewarding relationship.</p><p>The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and Jupiter (Philosophy) and Neptune (Illusion and Dreams) rules Pisces. When the Moon and Neptune come together, a beautiful spiritual connection is made. Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with warm, feminine energy. Together, they create an idealistic, almost divine relationship, one that puts much significance on dreams and illusions. Jupiter also rules Pisces. This Planet of Good Fortune adds a masculine energy to this planetary combination, representing philosophy, expansion and excesses. The nature of this combination offers a utopian relationship: It is drenched in emotional intrigue and is a true celestial bond. Emotion, depth, warmth, expansion — it all sounds too good to be true, doesn’t it. Though they both ask a lot of their love relationships, Cancer must be careful not to cramp the floating Fish, as Pisces will suffocate under too many demands.</p><p>Cancer and Pisces are both Water Signs. Since Water is a tangible, physical entity, Cancer and Pisces are generally very compatible. Pisces are in this world to create human connections, and when they come together with Cancerian intuition and nurturing, there is no stronger bond. So that this union does not wash out in a stream of romantic idealism, Cancer’s stable view of life holds them afloat. And it’s not a case of Cancer putting up with a dreamy Pisces mate: Cancer really understands emotional ambiguity and can help Pisces stabilize their ephemeral nature. Though Cancer could grow weary of their Pisces mate’s faraway nature, and though Pisces could be bothered by Cancer’s self-centeredness, it’s easy for this pair to find a compromise.</p><p>Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Though intuitive, in love, as in life, Cancer likes to get things moving with a good idea and a solid plan, and they’ll write it all down to keep track. Pisces, on the other hand, is more about going on instinct; they’d lose that plan as soon as Cancer handed it to them! Cancer needs to give Pisces the freedom to enjoy their external interests and to occasionally follow a whim undeterred. Pisces can show Cancer that completion is sometimes better than initiation, and that compromise without struggle can pay off. Cancer and Pisces feed off of each other’s energy well, and should be completely compatible in romance.</p><p>What’s the best thing about the Cancer-Pisces love match? Their similar emotional natures. Both have a great capacity for emotion and compassion, and both can act as teacher AND student. They complement and harmonize with one another very well. The overall empathy and commitment that these two Signs value in a relationship is what will keep the ties strong and long lasting between the Crab and the Fish.</p>

							<div id="leo_leo" class="hidden">
								<p>When two Leos join together in a love match, they draw a great deal of attention. Others hold their breath and take notice. Two such stunning, creative, gregarious individuals seem to deserve one another. Theirs is an unbeatable combination when it comes to socializing, heading a group, or even inspiring others in the ways of romance. This duo was instantly attracted to their fellow Lion’s good looks, and neither was shy in manifesting their desires.</p><p>As the Lion is King of the Jungle, the Leo-Leo combination roars with the energy and enthusiasm of two natural-born leaders. However, it is this same passion and bossiness that each must learn to tame to remain compatible. Devoted to the House of Pleasure, this couple enjoys the finer things in life and won’t think twice about showing one another a good time. Things can get dramatic, and each Leo feeds off the other’s need for constant attention.</p><p>Leo is ruled by the Sun. This is the perfect symbol of the Leo’s perception of self: positioned at the center of the planets. The Sun emanates a great light, power and strength.

								<p>When Virgo and Pisces join together in a love match, it generally makes for a healthy relationship. The two Signs are opposite one another within the Zodiac, and such Signs tend to be well balanced, one making up for qualities the other lacks. They are an easy-going, do-gooding duo, and often devote their time to helping others as well as one another. Each partner in this couple brings out the best aspects in the other.</p><p>Both Signs dote on and adore one another. They strive for a harmonious relationship and are very accepting and sympathetic people. Virgo can help Pisces fulfill dreams and ambitions and give them the tools they need to turn ideas into reality. Virgo will provide a solid, steady base for the more emotional and intuitive Fish. On the other hand, Pisces offers a gentle touch, kindness and an emotional depth that Virgo appreciates. Virgo is interested in material comforts and at times cannot understand the simplistic attitude of Pisces. Their life’s aspirations can be very different. Once they can accept and overcome this difference, and learn to combine their energies, theirs will be a very rewarding relationship.</p><p>Virgo is ruled by Mercury and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter and Neptune. When Mercury and Neptune come together a beautiful spiritual connection is made. Together, they represent an idealistic partnership. Pisces is also ruled by Jupiter. This adds a yang energy to the combination and represents philosophy, expansion and excesses. This trio brings excellent communication, empathy, imagination and creativity to the relationship.</p><p>Virgo is an Earth Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. Generally the two are very compatible, as both Water and Earth are real, tangible things. Pisces, as a Water Sign, is born to connect humankind, and when they come together with Earth there is not a stronger natural bond. Virgo may have a more stable view of life than their partner. They can help their lover ground that poetic Pisces nature. But too much of a good thing can turn to mud if both partners aren’t careful. Pisces’s flightiness may annoy Virgo, and Pisces may in turn feel that Virgo is too scientific. But it will be easy for them to find a way to work around these disparities.</p><p>Virgo and Pisces are both Mutable Signs. Both like to move from one arena to another as the feeling takes them. They each are continuously inspired and assisted by one another, forming a cyclical ring of new ideas and a steady stream of excitement. Conflict rarely arises between them, and when it does it quickly resolves itself. Both partners have learned the fine art of compromise.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Virgo-Pisces relationship? It’s their complementary and harmonious attitude toward one another. The overall empathy and commitment these two Signs value in a relationship is what will keep the ties strong and long lasting. Everyone will be envious of their devotion to one another, as well as to their friends and the community.</p>

								<p>When two Libras come together in a love affair, they form one of the most agreeable, romantic and well-balanced relationships around. Harmony and aesthetics are of utmost importance to Libra; two Libras together bring their magically balanced and beautiful touch to everything they do together. Libra is the Sign of Partnership; Libra loves to be in love, and two together spells relationship bliss. If they’re just dating, they spend their time at romantic movies and coffee houses; if they’re cohabiting, their house looks like an art gallery, full of the finest and loveliest of everything.</p><p>Libra wants everyone to love them — sometimes to a fault. They abhor conflict, and if one arises they’re apt to back down just to maintain the peace. It’s not that they’re insincere or that they don’t care, it’s that conflict makes them extremely uncomfortable. The Libra-Libra duo understands this about one another and it’s rare that either one will push the other to compromise their shared sensibilities. Libra is most balanced while in a relationship, and each of them love having someone to admire and dote upon. They’re happiest when they have someone with similar interests with whom to share their experiences.</p><p>Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love). Two Libras together share a blissful, romantic relationship full of beauty, sensuality and utter pleasure. It’s no wonder the two stay together! They spoil themselves and one another — sometimes to a fault. Too many rich foods and too much laziness can be bad for their health. Those are pleasures that prove hard to resist; both enjoy reclining and munching on a stem of grapes like the Greek goddess herself!</p><p>Libra is an Air Sign. They prize their mental abilities almost above all else; they enjoy intellectualism and appreciate art, films and all sorts of cultural pursuits. Persuasive, courteous and diplomatic, Libras are the fair judges of the world. Two together can use their diplomacy to smooth over almost any potential conflict with honor and decency.</p><p>Libra is a Cardinal Sign, a quality that allows them to initiate new projects and motivate others. Two Libras can work very well together toward any project they set their mind to.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Libra-Libra relationship? Their incredible sense of diplomacy, kindness and shared respect for one another. These two can make a lasting love connection due to their deep, mutual understanding of one another’s loves and needs. Their commitment is likely to be great and solid.</p>

								<p>When Libra and Scorpio come together in a love match, they tend to make a very emotionally connected and mutually satisfying union. Though Scorpio is a brooder who can get lost in the confusing welter of their own emotions, Libra’s proclivity for balance and harmony helps keep Scorpio even. Scorpio can return the favor to Libra with their characteristic powers of focus, a trait that Libra usually lacks. These two are very compatible due to their similar needs in a love relationship: Libra is the Sign of Partnership, and Libra is happiest when in a well-balanced and intimate relationship, while Scorpio thrives on emotional and sexual intimacy with their mate. These two Signs can make a very loyal, close and satisfying partnership.</p><p>These two would do well to undertake some sort of project together aside from their love relationship, as they have great potential to get great things done. They combine the power of emotion with the power of intellect, an extremely formidable duo. Scorpio tends to be more patient, but is also more controlling than Libra. Despite any differences, both partners love risk and taking chances; this is not a boring relationship! These two are real charmers; they know how to woo and seduce one another and take great pleasure in doing so. Their different styles — Scorpio is intense and secretive while Libra is upfront and open — sometimes make them have trouble understanding one another, so they may need to pay close attention to their communication at times.</p><p>Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Scorpio is dually ruled by the Planets Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power). Libra’s love of beauty and romance balances the strife that can arise in Scorpio’s life due to their deep, often tangled emotions. Scorpio’s Mars influence at least promises an active, exciting relationship. Also, neither Sign wants to argue. Scorpio avoids arguments in favor of secret revenge; Libra abhors conflict and will do anything possible to avoid it, including backing down and seeking a truce.</p><p>Libra is an Air Sign and Scorpio is a Water Sign. The best decisions are made combining the intellect and the emotions — using both the head and the heart, this couple can meet almost any challenge, understand almost any puzzle. This is all contingent, of course, on the two Signs working together, not against one another. Scorpio is a master strategist and can help Libra focus their occasionally scattered or indecisive minds. At times, however, Scorpio’s over-emotionalism can drag down and dishearten Libra, and Libra can occasionally make Scorpio feel flustered and uncomfortably stirred up. It is at these times when Libra’s natural diplomacy comes in most handy.</p><p>Libra is a Cardinal Sign and Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Libra is always thinking of something new to try: a new restaurant or art gallery to visit on a date or a new place to travel to — but it’s Scorpio who has the determination to follow through on these ideas. These two have the capability to be the most loyal and devoted of partners, as these are qualities that are quite important to each of them.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Libra-Scorpio relationship? The power they find in unity. They can accomplish a lot, whether they come together for a cause in the business or romantic sphere. They are both winners and they won’t give up, making theirs a relationship that takes care of business.</p>

								<p>The merging of Libra and Sagittarius can be paradise found for both Signs; this combination is a harmonious one, to say the least. Signs that are two positions apart in the Zodiac tend to have a very deep, special connection and understanding of one another. Sagittarius, the journeyer, is constantly in search of wisdom. Libra has a mind keen for art, beauty and aesthetics; Libra makes a stimulating companion for Sagittarius on their travels and adds much to Sagittarius’s experience. The relationship always feels new because these two keep it exciting — and yet their natural understanding of one another makes them feel like intimates from the beginning. Together they will reach new horizons in love and in life.</p><p>Libra and Sagittarius make great friends as well as lovers. They share a certain fresh-faced optimism in the world; they’re both enthusiastic about finding truth and beauty in their experiences. Problems rarely occur. Occasionally Sagittarius may hurt sensitive Libra’s feelings by speaking without thinking; conversely, Libra can sometimes be a bit too emotionally controlling for Sagittarius. Since Libra is a born diplomat who abhors conflict, they’ll be able to smooth over any ruffled feathers. These two have the gift of forgiving and forgetting quickly.</p><p>Libra is ruled by Venus (Love) and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (Luck and Philosophy). Venus’s femininity and Jupiter’s masculinity make these Signs compatible and balanced. Sagittarius is constantly on a quest for knowledge of the big things — the truth, the meaning of life and death — and whenever Libra comes up with a new idea (as they are wont to do) Sagittarius is eager to go along with their partner and become familiar with this new concept.</p><p>Libra is an Air Sign and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. This partnership is full of kinetic energy. As air spreads fire and makes it grow exponentially, this relationship is heated and ardorous. Sagittarius thinks they’re steering the rudder, but Libra controls the flow of events with a quieter hand. These two are energetic in the extreme and can run together far and wide. The relationship runs most smoothly when Sagittarius can feel they have plenty of freedom and independence within the relationship.</p><p>Libra is a Cardinal Sign and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Libra is an initiator; they think up new ideas and new places to go — but can change their minds at a moment’s notice. Sagittarius is flexible and adaptable, amenable to any changes Libra wants to make in plans.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of an Libra-Sagittarius relationship? Their mutual interest in cultivating knowledge and utilizing intellect. They are well-matched and will go far together, both emotionally and geographically!</p>

								<p>When Libra and Capricorn come together in a love match, they can be a good couple — if they can uncover their sometimes difficult to find similarities. On the surface, these two couldn’t be more different: While Capricorn is quiet and unassuming, Libra tends to be a social butterfly, delighting in visiting with other people. Capricorn is concerned with hard work as a means toward career advancement and recognition; Libra is concerned with beauty, art and balance in life and relationships. This is not to say, however, that there is no meeting point for these two; if they are coming from a base of mutual love and respect, they can work to find their common ground.</p><p>When these two Signs work together on a project or a problem, it works best if they have pre-set roles to fulfill, as they both like to take charge. Once their expectations are defined, their approaches are once again quite different: Libra is pondering and intellectual, but Capricorn sees the value of doing things the hard way if it leads to certain success. Once the partners understand each other’s style, their methods help them to achieve together what they could not achieve alone.</p><p>Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Capricorn is ruled by Planet, while Saturn is cold, hard and masculine. These Planets don’t have much in common so it’s important for Libra and Capricorn to work through their differences. Venus encourages Libra to slow down to take in the beauty and romance life offers; this can come across as laziness to Capricorn, whose Saturn influence lends them that dogged determination to push forward against all odds and succeed at the goals they set for themselves. These two Planets can work at cross-purposes, creating antagonism, strife and repressed emotions unless Libra and Capricorn make a concerted effort to understand and accept one another’s focus in life. Capricorn must take care not to discourage Libra from their natural enthusiasm and optimism, and Libra must put their natural diplomacy to use in order to maintain balance with Capricorn.</p><p>Libra is an Air Sign and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. Libra relies on their intellect in life; their sensibilities are attuned to aesthetics, a subject on which a true Libra always has lots of opinions. Capricorns rely on brain power as well, but of a different sort; they search for the pragmatic method in all they do, and may not feel they have time to dabble in aesthetics. If these two can learn to work as a team, they could form two sides of a coin, so to speak.</p><p>Libra and Capricorn are both Cardinal Signs. Both Signs are initiators, but they have such widely varying work ethics that they work better when they each have a particular, well-defined role. When it comes to conflict, Libra will be the first to back down, which will appease Capricorn (who likes to be right!). It’s important for both partners to understand that compromise is they key to their success.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Libra-Capricorn relationship? They each bring their own qualities to the relationship. Once they allow one another to be themselves — rather than getting in one another’s way — they can blend well to make a whole. Theirs is a challenging relationship, but they can learn from each other if they maintain the effort.</p>

								<p>When Libra and Aquarius join in a love match, their relationship can serve to heighten and strengthen both Signs’ consciousness. These two connect on a high mental level; they share a love of art, people and culture; they both abhor restrictive influences in their lives. They are likely to get along well because they have such similar needs and will not require more of one another than they’re both willing to give. Both Signs are also very energetic, enthusiastic types; this relationship is not likely to become stagnant.</p><p>Both Aquarius and Libra are concerned with the betterment of the world and their fellow people. Aquarius is the most progressive thinker of the Zodiac, and they always have a new idea in the works. Libra is the diplomat of the Zodiac; abhorring conflict of any sort, they are born balancers (hence their Symbol, the Scales). Libra’s urge to avoid conflict put together with a love of intellectual freedom can lead them to be somewhat indecisive at times; when this happens, more decisive Aquarius can step in and help Libra figure out which direction to turn. Libra can return the favor by smoothing Aquarius’s occasionally ruffled feathers that result from the Water Bearer’s idealistic thinking sometimes crashing down in the face of reality.</p><p>Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Uranus (Rebellion) and Saturn (Karma). This combination of influences can be an interesting and productive one; Libra and Aquarius should certainly take on other projects together than simply their love relationship, because they can make great things happen using their hearts, their urge for progress and their consciousness of the greater good. These two are an extraordinary duo for standing up for social justice or radical change in the community.</p><p>Both Libra and Aquarius are Air Signs. They have strong intellectual bonds to one another and constantly stimulate one another’s ideas and communication styles and skills. Again, their ability to work together makes it obvious that these two Signs must take on larger projects in their life together — they should concern themselves with the greater good. Libra can bring a certain balance to any undertaking that almost no other Sign is able to achieve. Aquarius and Libra together will also have many stimulating intellectual discussions about their interests and pursuits.</p><p>Libra is a Cardinal Sign and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Libra sets things into motion but may have trouble finishing them, which is what makes Aquarius’s determined influence so positive: The Water Bearer has a great deal of follow-through and can take Libra’s ideas and run with them to the end. These two work especially well together as they tend not to argue about who does what, who takes credit and who works behind the scenes versus out in the spotlight.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Libra-Aquarius relationship? Their ability to work together as a team. Together they can learn much more than either Sign would alone. Their accomplishments and love of socializing and new projects make theirs a highly successful relationship.</p>

								<p>When Libra and Pisces come together in a love affair, theirs is a congenial and even-tempered romance. These two Signs are very compatible, making for a truly smooth-sailing love affair. Both Signs are attuned to life’s aesthetic side, but they also have much to offer one another: When Pisces gets lost in a fantasy, Libra can apply that Libran proclivity for balance to help get Pisces back on track, and Pisces can return the favor by helping Libra see the beauty in love and empathy. This is an honest partnership that values truth and harmony in itself and in the world.</p><p>Libra and Pisces make great friends as well as lovers. They understand one another: Both can be indecisive and tend to work in multiple directions at once. Problems between these two are rare, but Libra can at times be too mentally manipulating for Pisces. Sometimes they can also stop mid-action due to both of their indecisive natures; if these two work on a project together — either their love relationship or something else — it can be difficult to get it to move forward. If these two do have an argument, they do tend to forgive and forget quickly: Libra abhors conflict and will do almost anything to avoid it, and Pisces possesses great empathy and can forgive out of understanding for their partner’s position.</p><p>Libra is ruled by Venus (Love) and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter (Luck) and Neptune (Illusions). These Signs are quite compatible due to the feminine energies of Venus and Neptune working in tandem. Under Jupiter and Neptune’s rule, Pisces is intensely meditative, philosophical and internal. Under Venus’s influence, Libra is in love with love. Libra is the Sign of Partnership and always is more comfortable when in an intimate love affair.</p><p>Libra is an Air Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. These two Signs together combine their heads and their hearts to solve all problems — a winning combination. The best decisions are made with both the emotions and the intellect; this relationship tends to be extremely flexible and progressive. When problems occur, however, the communication breaks down between Libra and Pisces. Libra, who can at times be mentally manipulative, may give Pisces ‘the silent treatment.’ In this partnership there’s always an undercurrent of friction but neither partner will ever truly be the leader. Although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don’t last long. Their only real trouble may result from their tendency to slow down to the point of stopping when they get together.</p><p>Libra is a Cardinal Sign and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Libra comes up with new ideas and starts new projects and Pisces is happy to go along with them, taking any role ‘assigned’ them. If these two take on a project other than their love relationship, they will work well together; both are outwardly modest, and Libra likes a bit of recognition while Pisces doesn’t mind the passenger’s seat. Also, if Libra generates a new idea but then suddenly loses interest (as sometimes happens), Pisces doesn’t mind switching directions as well.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of a Libra-Pisces relationship? Their mutual interest in helping individuals and the world around them. They are well-matched in their enthusiasm, energy and desire for a sincere relationship.</p>

								<p>When two Scorpions make a love match, it is a fierce tempest of intense passion. Both are obsessed with one another, and they move forward in love, sex and romance at an accelerated — some would say foolish — way. Personal relations are positively steamy but, to the equal and opposite extreme, disputes will also be frenetically powerful. This relationship could go either way: It will either be the most wonderful thing in the world or a destruction of both involved.</p><p>The romantic merger of two sexy Scorpions can bring out the best in both love mates; each will use their intense emotional and intuitive natures to love their partner very deeply. Resolve and passion will keep these two together. The most powerful and threatening external forces will have a difficult time intruding on the happiness of a truly committed Scorpio couple. If they can wrangle their ardent energies, this power pair can set off fireworks.</p><p>The Planets Mars and Pluto rule Scorpio. Mars is the ancient God of War, always charging forward — passionate, aggressive and courageous. Pluto is the higher octave of Mars and controls the power, destruction and rebirthing elements of the Scorpio-Scorpio relationship. These two planets together allow the Scorpion to bounce back after disappointments or tragic losses. Fortunately for the Scorpion, intense passions inflate the importance and loss of everything.</p><p>Scorpio is a Water Sign, so their first instinct in love is to respond deeply, passionately, fervently, and if they decide to express themselves, its never done halfway. Scorpios should commit themselves to this goal: Tame the vengeful or vindictive side of their intuitive personalities, and to celebrate the extreme ups and quickly forget the downs. A Scorpio must let go and really say what they want, what they feel, what they need, to their love mates. Pent-up emotions can become toxic, frustrating the one feeling them and confusing the one wondering about them. Because both are so devoted, jealousy may become an issue. Be strong, brave Scorpios, and overcome this hurdle together!</p><p>Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Idea shortages are never an issue with this pair. No couch potato couple this one — they like to stay active, and they’ll accomplish much together. They share a knack for investments and risks — calculated ones, that is. A Scorpio couple will thoroughly research and investigate an idea if that’s what it requires. Once Scorpio love mates set their eyes on the prize, that’s it — it’s theirs.</p><p>What’s the best thing about a Scorpio-Scorpio love match? The intensity of love that this couple can feel. They’re very goal-oriented, and their shared power makes them an incomparable, unconquerable duo! Utter devotion ensures that this relationship will continue for a long time.</p>

								<p>If a Scorpio and a Sagittarius want to make a love match, they should be warned to slow down, take their time getting to know one another on a deep, significant level or else they run the risk of getting way ahead of themselves. This relationship could be over before either partner even realizes it’s started if they’re not careful! Their patience will be very richly rewarded. Sagittarius thrives on change, on the new and the exciting and on the power of positive thought. Scorpio just wants to get closer and strengthen emotional ties. Early in the relationship, Sagittarius could feel hemmed in by Scorpio’s rapt attention and high expectations for love. If Scorpio can control their emotions, these two are in for satisfaction and excitement.</p><p>Both Scorpio and Sagittarius see each day as an adventure (or in Scorpio’s case, a compelling mystery) and as an endless opportunity to explore, to probe, to learn. Shared escapades bring them closer. While Sagittarius may get fed up with Scorpio’s stubbornness and inflexibility, Scorpio could be thinking their Sagittarius mate is just a little too hotheaded. They’ll enjoy learning together, and travel could be very beneficial for this pair. Their relationship is always on the go!</p><p>Pluto and Mars rule Scorpio, and Mars and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. Mars is the God of War, opening the door for Scorpio’s determined, courageous character. Mars, when combined with Pluto, represents rebirth and renewal. Jupiter focuses on philosophy, higher learning, expansion, optimism, luck and travel. These planetary attributes — of growth, expansion and masculine energy — combine to create a sustainable relationship of mutual admiration.</p><p>Scorpio is a Water Sign, and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. Sagittarius is the spontaneous partner, heading in the direction their whim leads them, while Scorpio’s motives are more subdued, less easy to read. Even if they run into misunderstandings or misinterpretations of each other’s motivations, crisis can be averted. If these love mates agree that their relationship is significant, their devotion and affection will see them through.</p><p>Scorpio is a Fixed Sign, and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Both of these love mates can multitask like pros, keeping each other’s interests at heart, juggling birthdays and special dates with family obligations, but it really takes Scorpio’s follow-through to get anything finished in this pair. Sagittarius gets the urge to jump around from project to project, so Scorpio’s stick-to-it-tivness comes in handy. Lucky for Scorp partners, Sagittarius notices all the work their mates put in — and they definitely show their appreciation when they know it’s needed. Scorpio can be stubborn, exacting and demanding, so this mate needs to give their Sagittarius love their personal space and time for their own interests. Scorpio leads Sagittarius’ ideas fruition, even if Sagittarius has lost interest and moved on. So they’re not all work and no play, Sagittarius comes through with their knack for flexibility, a positive quality that sometimes wins out over resolute determination.</p><p>What’s the best thing about the Scorpio-Sagittarius relationship? The security and flexibility they can give one another. Once they open up to one another and to appreciate their different philosophies in love and in life, these two have potential for steamy relations, deep connections and heartfelt respect. As long as they communicate and celebrate their differences, theirs will be a passionate relationship.</p>

								<p>When Scorpio and Capricorn make a love match, they get an opportunity to not only enjoy a loving relationship and learn the value of being a pair, but also to grow and mature as individuals. These two may be wary about sharing themselves with one another at first, and this emotional caution may dampen the initial impact of this relationship. These two tend to be a bit cautious (Capricorn) and pensive (Scorpio), and it takes a while for them to feel comfortable with a significant other. Though they may be shy of getting involved and not the quickest to trust and share, these two Signs will discover that they can have quite a profound connection — one of friendship and deep loyalty.</p><p>Much can be learned when a Scorpio and Capricorn get together — and the lessons they learn, while difficult at times to endure, are worth the trouble they might cause. From their stable, capable Capricorn mate, Scorpio can learn to bring their overheated emotions into control. Capricorn must be careful, though, not to seem too emotionally shallow when leveling any criticism on their sensitive love. Detached comments can backfire with Scorpios: They desire depth, intense feeling and the utmost in sincerity in all situations — most especially in love! Capricorn, so busy with achieving and with how others perceive them sometimes fails to take a chance with their emotions. From Scorpio, Capricorn will learn the value of looking below the surface of things, the rich pleasure that can come from deeply knowing another person. Both Signs share a love of committing to a task. If they decide a relationship is their next big goal to attain, there’s no stopping these two.</p><p>The Planets Mars and Pluto rule Scorpio, and the Planet Saturn rules Capricorn. Mars and Pluto represent aggression, courage, sexual energy, rebirth and renewal. Saturn teaches the great lessons in life — hard work, diligence, ambition and responsibility. These three Planets can combine in the Signs to form an industrious union bound by Scorpio’s fierce emotion and Capricorn’s ambitious action. This is a dynamic team for business, sure, but they all that achieving energy could translate well to affection and love.</p><p>Scorpio is a Water Sign, and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. Earth Signs are all about practical matters, about material possessions. What a good balance, then, for those of the Water element. Water Signs mold to the shape of the situation they’re in and often respond with emotion rather than logic. A match-up of Capricorn’s goal-oriented stability and Scorpio’s exciting mutability makes for quiet a team — whether they translate to love depends on whether love is their goal. If it is, expect success.</p><p>Scorpio is a Fixed Sign, and Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign. They may not seem the most romantic Sign of the Zodiac, but a Capricorn’s business and planning savvy could certainly be put to good use in devising elegant, well-planned nights of romance. If their Capricorn partner shows that much initiative, Scorpio will enthusiastically follow along, excitedly, if not a bit smugly, throwing in their own ideas, too. Scorpio can toss out some barbed comments under their breath or in such a sexy tone of voice that Capricorn might not even notice. A love-minded Sea Goat would do well to listen closely for subtle shades and nuances in their Scorpio partner’s voice and pay special attention to body language as well. Both Signs can be stubborn, and this could lead to some potential conflict. Also, Scorpio falls hard, emotionally involving themselves almost to the point of no return, in stark contrast to the sometimes-distant Sea Goat. Both partners must recognize this and accept it if the relationship is to be successful.</p><p>What’s the best thing about the Scorpio-Capricorn love match? Their determination toward shared ideas and their strong devotion to one another. They can open doors to one another’s souls and show one another new ways of perceiving and feeling.</p>

								<p>When Scorpio and Aquarius make a love match, it is a fusion of two very different life philosophies and many very different needs. There is much chance for friction here. Where Scorpio faces their inner emotional world directly and with an intense energy, thinking deeply about the more hidden undercurrents of life, Aquarius takes that same sort of energy and turns it outward. With their unusual, idealistic and, above all else, very social outlook on life, Aquarius seems an odd choice for the more introverted Scorpio. Aquarius needs a crowd to feel stimulated, and they’re always looking around the room for the next interesting person to get to know. Scorpio, on the other hand, desires engaging, probing and very intimate time with their romantic mates. This pair may seem to have very little in common, but they both have such strong wills that, when focused on their relationship, can get them what they need and want.</p><p>Both Scorpio and Aquarius can be uncooperative and opinionated: They like things to go their way, no questions asked! For this love match, though, ‘their ways’ are very dissimilar. Scorpio is inquisitive, digging deeply into the hidden meaning of things, always asking questions and wanting to know where things are going and why. Aquarius is progressive and affable yet does not enjoy detail. Scorpio may be enticed by their differences, as Aquarius shows them new, exterior worlds but may end up frustrated trying to get answers from this eccentric enigma. Aquarius does not welcome possessiveness, either, preferring to belong to the world rather than one single person. But a stinging Scorpion can be fiercely possessive, and they require more attention than an Aquarian might be able to give. If Aquarius slows down and pays attention, they may find the devotion Scorpio provides to be a great support.</p><p>The Planets Mars and Pluto rule Scorpio, and the Planets Saturn and Uranus rule Aquarius. Mars is a revolutionary, aggressive and spirited masculine energy, and Pluto enlightens these impulses and adds a rebirthing, cyclical quality. Saturn is a cool, contained energy, and Uranus is about all things different and unusual. Mars is emotional, reacting without thinking things through; such is the nature of Scorpio. Saturn demands of Aquarius much hard work and discipline, while Uranus gives them that forward thinking mind. A gentle Scorpio lover, careful not to tether an Aquarius in too tightly can teach their mate about a life based on emotional intuition, one that quiets the intellect sometimes in favor of physical sensation. Understanding Aquarians can teach their serious Scorpio mates to calm down, to detach themselves from uncontrollable situations and to reevaluate their goals if they get off course.</p><p>Scorpio is a Water Sign, and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Air is about the intellect, so Aquarius tackles life as one chance to grow and explore after another, while Scorpio is more analytical. Scorpio looks for purpose, and Aquarius seeks stimulation. These love mates have trouble understanding one another’s origin of thought. Confrontations arise is Scorpio’s possessiveness gets the better of them or if Aquarius seems too cool and flippant and denies Scorpio emotional reassurance. Both need to learn that they view the world in different ways and they should celebrate and laugh at their differences.</p><p>Scorpio and Aquarius are both Fixed Signs. Both can be unyielding, dogmatic and persevering. If they have a plan, they’ll stick to it until their efforts are rewarded. Once they have made up their minds that they are good mates for one another, they will never be discouraged from maintaining the relationship. But they may have such contradictory approaches to life that their relationship gets more difficult than it is pleasurable. If they believe in the value of the relationship, they will be able to overcome differences.</p><p>What’s the best thing about the Scorpio-Aquarius relationship? Their capacity for success in their synergy. Both Signs have very powerful personalities, so neither will openly dominate the other. Once they can appreciate their differences, come together and agree on their individual roles within the relationship, the results can be intensely gratifying.</p>

								<p>When Scorpio and Pisces make a love match, theirs is a splendid union of much respect and understanding. These mates share the same Element — Water — and thus have keen insight into one another’s minds and hearts. Scorpio is very profound and covert, often caught up in their own secret plans, while Pisces is idealistic and looks for the nuances of a situation. However, Pisces also has a tendency to withdraw into their own mind, and can forgive Scorpio for being mysterious or withdrawn at times.</p><p>Both Signs are intuitive and in touch with the subtleties of human interaction. Scorpio can help Pisces fulfill dreams and ambitions — to turn ideas into reality. The Scorpion will provide a steadfast foundation for the relationship to revolve around, and the more ephemeral and intuitive Fish will become entangled in Scorpio’s web. In return, Pisces offers gentleness, kindness, and sympathy, which Scorpio admires and appreciates. Scorpio is interested in certain material comforts and intense emotional dramas, and at times cannot understand the simplistic, charitable attitude of Pisces. Their long-term aspirations can be completely unalike. Once they can understand and overcome this difference, theirs will be a very rewarding relationship.</p><p>Mars and Pluto rule Scorpio, and Jupiter and Neptune rule Pisces. Mars is the ancient God of War, and Scorpio individuals are living proof of this aggressive, courageous, daring and sometimes-belligerent influence. When Pluto combines with Mars, Pluto comes to symbolize new beginnings. Scorpio can take it, but they can also most certainly give it. Jupiter’s rule of Pisces represents philosophy, expansion and excesses. The Neptunian influence gives Pisces a dreamy aura and a love for popular culture and media. Pisces dreamy, ethereal energy softens their Scorpio love’s rough edges. The composite power of these four planets creates a balanced relationship, one of drama and emotional intrigue; this is a true celestial bond. However, a Scorpio mate must let their beloved Fish swim about a bit; a sensitive Pisces will suffocate under too many demands.</p><p>Scorpio and Pisces are both Water Signs. They’re so compatible because Water is a tangible, physical entity, and both Signs appreciate and use this characteristic to their advantage. The destiny of a Pisces is to bring people together, and when this energy meets Scorpio’s intensity and tenacity, there is no stronger bond. Also, Scorpio has an absolutist view of life; everything is either golden or tarnished. A patient Pisces opens the world up to their Scorpio mate, allowing them to see the bigger picture rather than just all that minute detail. Scorpio could grow weary of Pisces’s unsteadiness, and Pisces may see Scorpio as self-absorbed and insensitive to their emotional needs. Still, it’s not beyond these partners to seek out and find a compromise.</p><p>Scorpio is a Fixed Sign, and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Scorpio puts their energy into one thing at a time, but Pisces skips around to wherever their feelings take them. Pisces, as a Mutable Water Sign, then, molds easily into their Scorpio lover’s life and pastimes. In turn, Scorpio needs to give Pisces the freedom to enjoy personal interests. A Pisces can show a Scorpio that flexibility can be fun and exciting, that compromise can be reached without a big fight or struggle. The energies of a Scorpio and a Pisces feed off of one another’s energy well, making for a powerful and emotionally satisfying union.</p><p>What’s the best thing about a Scorpio-Pisces love match? Their similarly intense emotional natures, their shared sensitivity to the undercurrents of life, to the more ethereal magic of love. This is a relationship of harmony and fulfillment. Scorpio and Pisces both live empathetically and seek true, profound commitments, and this connection will keep the ties strong and their love enduring.</p>

								<p>When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving natures makes theirs a near perfect relationship. This couple views the world around them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more knowledge. They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and banter that challenges and tickles the mind. An occasional hotheaded dispute can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic Sag partner carries things a little too far.</p><p>Easygoing and independent, these two are compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests. They’ve never known jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with their lover. When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing their partner and satiating common interests. Although they are adaptable and modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle. However, it is not in the Archer’s nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long.</p><p>Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter. Expansion is the key word here; as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over exiting ideas into their relationship. They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as such gluttony will only distract them. Their charm and charisma make them a very pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd.</p><p>Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. When these two Fire Signs come together, they merge to build a bigger flame. They constantly reach out together and experience life: They love to take trips more than just reading about places in tour books. Outgoing and friendly, it is the downfall of many Sagittarians to speak before thinking, thus finding themselves in an awkward social bind. These two love to engage in new projects, but neither have the dedication to stick to their guns. Both are far too eager to move ahead to the next new thing.</p><p>Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. The flirty, excitable Sag is easy to get along with, for the most part. Arguments rarely ensue between them. Both are extremely accommodating to their significant other. Every so often a stubborn thorn will pop up, but neither partner wants to stay with this subject, and so the matter is dropped completely.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship? It’s their compatibility and shared desire for knowledge. This couple has found the perfect balance between intensity and allowing the other room to breathe. Together, they will explore the vast outside worlds as well as the worlds of the intellect.</p>

								<p>When Sagittarius and Capricorn join together in a love match, things may start slow and they may feel that they don’t have much to gain from the other. In some ways, Sagittarius and Capricorn are opposites: Sagittarius is easy going, whimsical, seeks knowledge for its own sake, always jumps headfirst into new things, and is typically impatient. Capricorn is detail-oriented and passive, even shy, and is always looking toward the next project. Their differences can actually forge a stronger relationship in the long run, there being vast amounts each partner can learn from the other.</p><p>Early in the relationship, Sagittarius and Capricorn may not be able to see past one another’s flaws. Sagittarius can at times seem unruly, and Capricorn may come across pompous and elitist. But once they stop focusing on one another’s faults and look to their respective strengths, they’ll see a vast pool of attractive qualities. Sagittarius can show Capricorn adventure and excitement, and can offer a glimpse of the freedom so often missing from Capricorn’s life. Capricorn teaches Sagittarius to pay attention to detail, uncovers the knowledge that the little things are important, and helps them to harness their random energy. Sagittarius may view Capricorn as too responsible, and will teach their partner to lighten up. Capricorn may accuse Sagittarius of being reckless and impulsive, and can help them to become well mannered.</p><p>Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter and Capricorn follows the Planet Saturn. Jupiter is about higher learning, philosophy, expansion of knowledge and good luck that sometimes leads to excess. Saturn is the ruler of hard work, assiduousness, ambition and responsibility. Their affects on one another can be positive and tend to bring out each other’s best aspects. Both Signs need to take a step back to appreciate their partner’s approach; Sagittarius can teach Capricorn to be more spontaneous, while at the same time gaining stability from Capricorn’s rational outlook.</p><p>Sagittarius is a Fire Sign, and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. Sagittarius initiates projects after philosophical evaluation, while Capricorn takes more practical, factual approach. Capricorn will think about the consequences of their activities, whereas Sagittarius loves to explore merely for their own personal satisfaction. Although these partners may have difficulties arising from their diverse morals, when they put their differences aside they make an excellent couple due to their well-rounded, complementary natures.</p><p>Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign, and Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign. Sagittarius isn’t necessarily a leader or motivating force; when they have a good idea and see a way to contribute, they enjoy doing their part. Capricorn, on the other hand, comes up with the ideas and assigns roles to others. Sagittarius and Capricorn can work toward the same goals with great success due to a lack of conflict over roles.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Sagittarius-Capricorn relationship? It’s their effectiveness in working out minor bumps in the road. When they overcome their initial resistance to one another, this pair will see how much they have to gain from one another.

								<p>When Sagittarius and Aquarius join together in a love match, Aquarian ideals and Sagittarian knowledge combine to make them a creative and unique couple. This partnership is uninhibited, and while it can get competitive with these two, there’s never a dull moment! Underneath any romantic overtone, there exists a great friendship; their Signs are two apart and this tends to give them an ability to communicate well as well as an excellent rapport. Both are idealistic and excited about life, and together they enjoy great times. Together, the two can fly without fear of falling.</p><p>Many Sagittarius-Aquarius relationships enjoy the feeling of mutual admiration. Sagittarius is attracted to Aquarius’s individuality, vision and creative capacity. Aquarius admires Sagittarian excellence and initiative — Sagittarius is always coming up new ideas, but they aren’t always able to carry them out the way Aquarius can. Both Signs relish their independence, and there aren’t many conflicts because each understands this about the other. At times, Sagittarius may seem too selfish for Aquarius, who in turn may be too out-there for their Sagittarian partner. As long as they communicate their happiness about the relationship, they will overcome any bumps in the road, major or minor.</p><p>Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter and Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn and Uranus. These three Planets form a sort of cycle that typifies the Sagittarius-Aquarius relationship, especially their ability to see eye-to-eye. Uranus is the Planet of new ideas and creativity; it’s from this Planet that Aquarius gets its grandiose ideas. Then Jupiter steps in with its influences toward higher learning, expansion and abundance. Finally Saturn keeps the process going to completion, following up after Uranus’s inspiration has been exhausted and Jupiter’s energy moves on to new things.</p><p>Sagittarius is a Fire Sign and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and keeps it going much in the same way that Aquarius can inspire Sagittarius to make great leaps. Sagittarius can keep up with the Water Bearer’s tendency to engage in experiments based on futuristic ideas. When they come together, they are an innovative, inventive team! Aquarius and Sagittarius use intellect and a sense of adventure to gain new experiences — each fosters creativity in the other. Both Signs have a wide variety of interests, and Sagittarius’s need to get in on the action gives them ease with which to put the plans of the idea-generating Aquarius into action.</p><p>Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Sag rolls with the punches and is happy to stop what they are doing to tend to other matters. Aquarius is slightly less adjustable, more into sustaining a project already in progress as long as they are passionate about its completion. Aquarius can help situate and resolve issues rather than jumping blindly into new ones, whereas Sagittarius is happy to drift from one subject to the next as the mood takes them. They are both loyal and devoted to one another, and they can get past a lot together.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Sagittarius-Aquarius relationship? It’s their ability to resolve difficult issues when they put their hearts in the matter. Mutable Fire and Fixed Air cover all the bases: These partners can stick with an idea once it’s firmly implanted.

								<p>When Sagittarius and Pisces join together in a love match, a relationship of realized dreams is formed. Sagittarius is more of a thinker and philosophizer, easily drifting around from one pursuit to the next. Pisces is more inward, involved in the shifting of their own mindscape. They are opposites in some respects, and to outsiders may seem an unlikely pair. But as their love for one another grows, they are more likely to be able to satisfy the philosophical cravings of the other and maintain a healthy relationship.</p><p>Sagittarius is outgoing and versatile, and in a relationship with Pisces often comes to the defense of their gentler partner. Pisces, in turn, gives Sagittarius subtle understanding and a place to escape from their tireless endeavors. Pisces is a Sign that, like Water, adapts easily to its surroundings; Pisces tends to focus much energy on understanding and sympathizing with their partner. They are often more patient with Sagittarius’s aloofness than other Signs. Sagittarius’s active pursuit of knowledge combines with Pisces’s gentle compassion towards others to give both partners a self-awareness that doesn’t pass into egocentricity and isn’t overly accommodating, such as Pisces alone may be.</p><p>Sagittarius and Pisces are both ruled by the Planet Jupiter. Pisces is also ruled by Neptune. Jupiter brings exploration and outreach to both Signs. Pisces is concerned with this aspect in an abstract sense; they often find themselves trying to save the world (perhaps in the form of recycling or environmentalism). Sagittarius, on the other hand, prefers to broaden their horizons through academics. Neptune is about big pictures, ideas and illusions; but it’s also involved with disillusion and fantasy. Sagittarius can help Pisces plant its feet on the ground. Jupiter works through Pisces to put a gentler touch on Sagittarius’s occasional hotheaded outbursts.</p><p>Sagittarius is a Fire Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. These two elements can form a great couple if they give in a little, using innate understanding of situations and people to get matters resolved. Pisces can offer Sagittarius direction and help them learn to be gentler, while Sagittarius teaches Pisces to go out and explore the world. This couple will enjoy traveling together. Pisces can be emotionally draining for the Archer at times, too much Water dampening Sagittarius’s fiery spirit. Conversely, too much Fire can boil the Water and leave Pisces steaming. Sagittarius and Pisces must use their perceptive skills to enhance the relationship, always focusing on what the other needs.</p><p>Sagittarius and Pisces are both Mutable Signs. Neither partner feels a need to dominate the relationship. They enjoy equality and like to see their ideas come to fruition. Pisces gets great happiness from helping Sagittarius. Sagittarius and Pisces enjoy dreaming up ideas and putting them into action. No one is preoccupied with end results; for this couple, the fun is in the journey!

Shared love of a comfortable, yet fancy, home life ensures that this couple will aspire to a higher ground.</p><p>Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. While Capricorn tends to focus on one project at a time, Pisces floats from one thing to another as the feeling strikes them.

This couple gets along quite well, perhaps incurring the slight jealousies of all their friends. Together, they enjoy following current events and discussing modern, progressive ideas.</p><p>Independent and cosmopolitan, all of their socializing could leave this couple somewhat emotionally detached. They spend most of their time away from the home, and they work well together as part of a larger whole: an organization, business or group. Sometimes, this couple has a great difficulty detecting or expressing real feelings, either their own, their partners or those of the people around them. They share certain ideas of how people should behave, which is more often than not an impersonal outlook.</p><p>Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn and Uranus. Uranus controls radical or novel ideas. Always reaching out with their idealistic visions, the Aquarian intellect can be so extreme and eccentric that Aquarius is known as the Einstein of the Zodiac. They can be too intense for the rest of the world, and they are often misinterpreted simply as brains. However, Saturn contains a great work ethic, tenacity and responsibility, and steers the Aquarian relationship to work hard through any problems that may arise. This ethic makes the couple very productive and well respected.</p><p>Aquarius is an Air Sign. Brainstorming and confronting issues with their superior intellectual abilities is second nature to them. The same rational drive that makes the Aquarian couple self-confident and self-assured can also be the source of any emotional or physical detachment that may arise between the two. They are a great team and share wonderful conversation, but the intimacy of the relationship may take a lot of hard work and effort. Also, they can be cold toward those they find banal and mundane.</p><p>Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. This quality can make the couple highly productive as well as dreadfully stubborn. Ideas flow from the creative Aquarian mind and both partners respect one another’s contributions to a shared goal. However, sometimes strong opinions will clash and lead to an all-out dispute. Both partners share a dislike for those who don’t share their lust for progress.</p><p>What’s the best aspect of the Aquarius-Aquarius relationship?

Problems are rare, but sometimes Aquarius can be too intellectual and aloof for Pisces, and Pisces may at times be too self-sacrificing and gullible for the Aquarian taste.

Pisces likes to be where Aquarius’s action and intellect stirs, and Aquarius can learn social tolerance and warmth from the demure Pisces. This team works well together. Although they may disagree, their differences of opinion don’t last long. Conflicts may arise because of Pisces’s need for emotional support and tenderness, and Aquarius’s preference for ideas rather than romance.</p><p>Aquarius is a Fixed Sign and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Aquarius initiates new ideas and changes, and Pisces will accept these as long as they have an assigned role in bettering the relationship.

They share a love of beauty and peace unparalleled in the Zodiac, and both are equally committed to maintaining this ideal relationship.</p><p>The passive Pisces nature affords this couple peaceful times. However, Pisces can be too easygoing, sometimes gullible, and is extremely sensitive to negative energy. Two Pisces together can become lethargic, lazy or bring out the best and worst in one another. They are often unable to set limits for themselves or others, and can wander off too far in a spiritual direction. Pisces tend to elude any conflicts with a disappearing act, either with unrealistic optimism or by hiding out in a life of fantasy.

Pisces share a great sense of ethics and values and live life with a philosophical outlook as reflected by the Planet Jupiter. Neptune is in charge of Pisces’s relationship with pop culture, abstract thought, imagination and mystery. Pisces is a Sign of service.
